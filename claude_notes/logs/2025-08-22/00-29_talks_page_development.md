**Date**: 2025-08-22
**Time**: 00:29
**Session Focus**: Created comprehensive Talks & Presentations page with video/slides integration

## Summary
Developed a new Talks & Presentations page featuring expandable cards with embedded YouTube videos and Google Slides presentations. Added local thumbnail support, implemented proper dark mode fixes for React Flow controls, and refined UI elements across multiple pages.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Talks Page Creation
- **New Files**:
  - `apps/web/app/(default)/talks/page.tsx` - Main talks page component
  - `apps/web/lib/talks-data.ts` - Talks data structure and content
- **Features**:
  - Expandable cards showing talk details (venue, date, media availability)
  - YouTube video embedding with timestamp support
  - Google Slides embedding with manual controls
  - Local PNG thumbnail support for reliability
  - "Other Talks" section for presentations without media

### 2. Google Slides Integration
- Converted multiple Google Slides edit URLs to embed URLs for direct embedding
- Implemented responsive iframe wrapper with aspect-video ratio
- Manual control mode (start=false&loop=false) for all embedded presentations
- Presentations embedded:
  - Debiasing with Diffusion (ITC Lunch Talk)
  - Probabilistic Completion (EAS 2024)
  - Scaling and In-Context Learning (NTT Journal Club)
  - 3D Probabilistic Reconstruction (Astro AI Workshop)
  - And 6 more presentations

### 3. Thumbnail System Implementation
- Added local PNG thumbnails in `/apps/web/public/images/talks/`
- Thumbnails added (20 total):
  - debiasing-with-diffusion.png
  - probabilistic-completion.png
  - scaling-icl-ntt.png
  - compositional-stanford.png
  - fundamental-abilities-hms.png
  - prague-new-news.png
  - reason-wall-nvidia.png
  - icl-kaist.png
  - icl-tokyo.png
  - phd-defense.png
  - fundamental-ai-astroai.png
  - neuroethology-ai-cbs.png
  - 3d-probabilistic-recons.png
  - recons-local-kavli.png
  - diffusion-cosmology.png
  - hshs-dl4sci.png
  - syiss.png
  - mstar2mcdm.png
  - compositional-harvard.png
- Priority system: Local PNG → YouTube thumbnail → Google Slides API

### 4. UI/UX Improvements

#### Navigation Updates
- Added "Talks" to main navigation menu after "Publications"
- Updated navigation order: CV → Ongoing → Publications → Talks → Blog → News

#### Color Coding System
- **Talks Page**:
  - Blue bar: Invited talks
  - Purple bar: Ph.D. Defense
  - Amber bar: Informal/semi-formal talks (journal clubs, workshops)
  - Green bar: Regular talks
- **Publications Page**:
  - Changed thesis color from gray to purple (matching Ph.D. Defense)
  - Changed preprints from yellow to amber (consistency with informal talks)

#### Icon System Refinement
- Changed venue icon from Presentation to MapPin (avoiding confusion)
- Kept Presentation icon for slides indicator
- Play icon for video indicator
- Added media availability indicators in collapsed card view

#### Dark Mode Fixes
- Fixed React Flow controls becoming white-on-white in dark mode
- Applied theme-aware classes: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`
- Override ReactFlow default styles with Tailwind utilities

### 5. Data Extraction and Organization
- Extracted 22 unique talks from publications.tex (23 entries with 1 duplicate)
- 20 talks with media (videos/slides)
- 3 talks without media listed separately
- Added venue annotations: "(Invited)", "(National Representative)"
- Corrected dates (e.g., Harvard II Lab talk: Nov 13 → Oct 30, 2024)

### 6. Video Features
- YouTube timestamp support (e.g., Debiasing talk starts at 56:33)
- Embedded video players with full controls
- External link buttons for opening in YouTube

## Technical Details

### React Components
- Used `useState` for managing expanded cards
- Conditional rendering for video/slides based on `primaryContent` flag
- Error handling for failed thumbnail loads with fallback icons

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Thumbnail sizes: w-32 h-20 (mobile) → w-40 h-24 (desktop)
- Text sizes adjusted for mobile readability

### Performance Optimizations
- Local thumbnails reduce external API calls
- Lazy loading of embedded content (only when expanded)
- Efficient state management for card expansion

## Files Modified
- `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` - Added Talks link
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/publications/page.tsx` - Updated color scheme
- `/apps/web/components/research-flow.tsx` - Fixed dark mode controls
- `/apps/web/lib/talks-data.ts` - Multiple updates for thumbnails and embed URLs

## Issues Resolved
- Fixed HTML hydration error (div inside p tag)
- Fixed React Flow controls visibility in dark mode
- Fixed duplicate NVIDIA talk entry
- Corrected multiple talk dates based on resume.json

## Next Steps Potential
- Add search/filter functionality to Talks page
- Implement talk categories or tags
- Add citation information for talks
- Consider adding download links for slide PDFs
- Integrate with calendar for upcoming talks
