# Google Analytics Integration Log
**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Time:** 01:21  
**Project:** Academic Homepage - Google Analytics Setup

## Summary
Integrated Google Analytics (GA4) into the Next.js academic homepage with proper error handling and environment variable configuration for both local and production environments.

## Major Tasks Completed

### 1. Google Analytics Component Creation
- Created `/apps/web/components/google-analytics.tsx` component
- Used Next.js Script component with `afterInteractive` strategy for optimal loading
- Added comprehensive error handling:
  - Returns `null` if no GA ID configured (won't break site)
  - Try-catch blocks around gtag initialization
  - Error handlers for script loading failures
  - Console logging for debugging without breaking functionality

### 2. Environment Variable Setup
- Created `.env.local` with GA tracking ID (`G-ZDH9GPMH57`)
- Created `.env.example` as template for other developers
- Verified `.env.local` is properly gitignored (line 28 in `.gitignore`)
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` to Vercel dashboard for production

### 3. Layout Integration
- Added GoogleAnalytics component to `/apps/web/app/(default)/layout.tsx`
- Ensured single GA tag per page (not added to simple layout)
- Properly positioned before ThemeProvider for early loading

### 4. Deployment
- Built project locally to verify no compilation errors
- Deployed preview to Vercel
- Deployed to production with environment variables
- Confirmed GA tracking active on production site

## Technical Details

### Component Features
- Graceful fallback if GA is blocked by ad blockers
- No hardcoded tracking ID in component (uses env var)
- Logs helpful messages for debugging
- Works with or without GA configuration

### Files Modified
- `/apps/web/components/google-analytics.tsx` (created)
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/layout.tsx` (added GA component)
- `/apps/web/.env.local` (created)
- `/apps/web/.env.example` (created)

## Notes

- Environment variable must be set in Vercel dashboard for production
- Site remains fully functional even if GA fails to load
- No duplicate GA tags on any page
