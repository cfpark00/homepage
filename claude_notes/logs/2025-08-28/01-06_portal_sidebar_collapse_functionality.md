# Portal Sidebar Collapse Functionality Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-28
**Time:** 01:06
**Main Task:** Implementing desktop sidebar collapse functionality for the research portal

## Summary
Added sidebar collapse functionality for desktop mode in the research portal, allowing users to hide/show the sidebar while maintaining proper layout and navigation.

## Key Changes

### 1. Sidebar Component Updates (`apps/portal/components/sidebar-simple.tsx`)
- Added desktop collapse state management using `isDesktopCollapsed` from context
- Added collapse button with `ArrowLeftToLine` icon in sidebar header (desktop only)
- Fixed CSS classes to properly show/hide sidebar:
  - Base: `fixed` with `-translate-x-full` (hidden on mobile)
  - Desktop: `lg:translate-x-0 lg:static` (visible by default)
  - Desktop collapsed: `lg:-translate-x-full lg:fixed` (hidden when collapsed)
- **Critical fix:** Added `lg:translate-x-0` to reset transform on desktop (was causing sidebar to be invisible)

### 2. Sidebar Context (`apps/portal/components/sidebar-context.tsx`)
- Added `isDesktopCollapsed` and `setIsDesktopCollapsed` to context
- Updated `toggleSidebar` to handle desktop collapse state
- Removed unnecessary `isDesktopOpen` state after refactoring

### 3. Portal Layout (`apps/portal/components/portal-layout-simple.tsx`)
- Removed props passing for sidebar state (now handled by context)
- Initially added floating hamburger button for collapsed state (later removed)
- Cleaned up to use context-based state management

### 4. PageHeader Component (`apps/portal/components/page-header.tsx`)
- HamburgerButton now shows on desktop when sidebar is collapsed
- Uses conditional classes: `isDesktopCollapsed ? "block" : "lg:hidden"`
- Properly integrated hamburger into header instead of floating button

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### Problem 1: Sidebar Not Visible at All
**Issue:** Sidebar was completely hidden even when not collapsed on desktop
**Root Cause:** The `-translate-x-full` from mobile was still applying on desktop
**Solution:** Added `lg:translate-x-0` to explicitly reset the transform on desktop

### Problem 2: Hamburger Button Not Showing
**Issue:** When sidebar was collapsed, no way to bring it back
**Initial Approach:** Added floating hamburger button in PortalLayoutInner
**Final Solution:** Used existing HamburgerButton in PageHeader with proper conditional display

### Problem 3: State Management Confusion
**Issue:** Complex state with `isDesktopOpen` and `isDesktopCollapsed`
**Solution:** Simplified to just `isDesktopCollapsed` - sidebar is either visible (static) or hidden (translated off-screen)

### Problem 4: Desktop Collapse Acting Like Mobile Popup
**Issue:** Initial implementation showed sidebar as overlay on desktop when hamburger clicked
**Solution:** Removed overlay behavior for desktop, made sidebar slide back to static position

## Technical Details

### CSS Classes for Sidebar States:
```
Mobile closed: fixed -translate-x-full
Mobile open: fixed translate-x-0
Desktop normal: lg:static lg:translate-x-0
Desktop collapsed: lg:fixed lg:-translate-x-full
```

### State Flow:
1. User clicks collapse button (ArrowLeftToLine) â†’ `setIsDesktopCollapsed(true)`
2. Sidebar slides off-screen, hamburger appears in PageHeader
3. User clicks hamburger â†’ `setIsDesktopCollapsed(false)`
4. Sidebar slides back to static position

## Files Modified
- `/apps/portal/components/sidebar-simple.tsx` - Main sidebar component
- `/apps/portal/components/sidebar-context.tsx` - State management
- `/apps/portal/components/portal-layout-simple.tsx` - Layout wrapper
- `/apps/portal/components/page-header.tsx` - Header with hamburger button

## Debugging Process
Added console.log statements and visual debug indicators (red overlay) to track state:
- Used colored emoji logs (ðŸ”´, ðŸ”µ) to differentiate components
- Added red debug box showing collapse state
- Made hamburger button red for visibility during testing
- All debug code removed after fixing issues

## Final Behavior
- Desktop: Sidebar visible by default, can collapse with arrow button, shows hamburger in header when collapsed
- Mobile: Standard hamburger menu with overlay behavior unchanged
- Smooth transitions between states with proper layout reflow

## Notes
- The key insight was that Tailwind's responsive prefixes need explicit resets (e.g., `lg:translate-x-0` to override base `-translate-x-full`)
- Context-based state management simplified the component communication significantly
- Keeping mobile and desktop behaviors separate in CSS made the logic clearer
