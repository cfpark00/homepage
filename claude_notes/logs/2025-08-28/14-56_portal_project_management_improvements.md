# Portal Project Management System Improvements

## Date: 2025-08-28, 14:56

## Summary
Comprehensive improvements to the portal app's project management system, including project ordering configuration, tab standardization, scrollbar styling fixes, and icon updates for better visual consistency.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Project Ordering System Analysis
- **Investigated project sorting in portal app:**
  - Projects ordered by date (newest first) in `getAllProjects()` function
  - Priority: `last_updated_at` field, fallback to `created` field
  - Sorting happens at `/apps/portal/lib/projects.ts:112-116`

### 2. Project Date Updates
- **Adjusted project creation/update dates for proper ordering:**
  - example-research: c 8/24, lu 8/24
  - evolution-research-constraints: c 8/25, lu 8/25  
  - example-research: c 8/25, lu 8/25
  - domain-ablated-llms: c 8/26, lu 8/26
  - dopamine-curiosity: c 8/26, lu 8/26
  - llms-dopamine: c 8/26, lu 8/26
  - grand-synthetic-data: c 8/27, lu 8/27
  - origins-representations: c 8/27, lu 8/28
  - representational-unification: c 8/28, lu 8/28 (unchanged)

### 3. Origins-Representations Content Cleanup
- **Removed subtab fields causing phantom tabs:**
  - Deleted subtab: "core", "related-work", "neuroscience" fields
  - These were appearing as separate tabs incorrectly
- **Removed extra publications:**
  - Deleted "From Next-Token to Mathematics" paper
  - Deleted "Invariant representations of mass" paper
  - Kept only FER hypothesis paper as requested

### 4. Tab Order Standardization
- **Standardized first three tabs across all projects:**
  - Order: Overview → Thoughts → Literature
  - Applied to all 8 projects in portal
  - example-research had additional tabs after these three

### 5. Scrollbar Styling Fix
- **Fixed scrollbar appearance in project tabs:**
  - Applied scrollbar styling classes per `/claude_notes/docs/ui_and_styling/scrollbar-styling-pitfall.md`
  - Added to TabsList component: `scrollbar-thin scrollbar-thumb-border scrollbar-track-transparent`
  - Added webkit-specific styles for cross-browser compatibility

### 6. Thoughts Tab Icon Update
- **Updated icon to match webapp's thoughts page:**
  - Imported `TfiThought` from `react-icons/tfi`
  - Added to iconMap as `Brain: TfiThought`
  - All project metadata files updated to use "Brain" icon identifier
  - Now consistent with webapp's vertical timeline markers

### 7. Project Library Updates
- **Updated types in projects.ts:**
  - Modified Thought interface to include `parent_id?: [string, number]`
  - Changed Project interface to use `DailyThoughts[]` instead of simple thoughts array
  - Added support for both old and new thought formats

### 8. Project Items Restructuring
- **origins-representations items.json updated:**
  - Removed literature tab items
  - Redistributed items to overview tab
  - Added new papers tab items
  - Updated with proper experiment, dataset, and analysis items

## Files Modified
- `/apps/portal/lib/projects.ts` - Type updates for thoughts system
- `/apps/portal/components/project-tabs.tsx` - Icon imports, scrollbar styling
- `/apps/portal/content/projects/*/metadata.json` - All 8 project metadata files
- `/apps/portal/content/projects/origins-representations/items.json` - Content cleanup

## Key Improvements
1. Projects now properly ordered by date with clear hierarchy
2. Tab order standardized for better UX consistency
3. Scrollbar styling matches app-wide design system
4. Icon consistency between webapp and portal
5. Cleaner content structure in origins-representations project

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more projects with appropriate dates
- Monitor scrollbar behavior across different browsers
- Potential to add more sophisticated project filtering/sorting options
