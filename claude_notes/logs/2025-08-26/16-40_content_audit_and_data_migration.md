# Content Audit and Data Migration

## Date: 2025-08-26, 16:40

## Summary
Conducted a comprehensive content audit of the website architecture, successfully migrated Talks and Publications systems to content-driven architecture, removed unused code, and improved the framework's modularity by moving configuration to content directories.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Content Audit and Documentation Update
- Reviewed entire codebase structure to understand current content architecture
- Updated `/CONTENT_AUDIT.md` with current state:
  - Identified fully migrated systems: Blog, Projects, News, Publications
  - Identified hybrid systems: Talks (was in `/lib`)
  - Identified hardcoded systems: CV page, Home page
  - Noted new additions: Portal app (Orchestra), Beta blog system, API routes
- Removed references to non-existent pages (Ongoing Projects, Research Tools)

### 2. Talks System Migration
- Created backup: `/apps/web/lib/talks-data.ts.backup`
- Created `/apps/web/content/talks/` directory
- Extracted 19 talks to `/apps/web/content/talks/talks.json`
- Updated `talks-data.ts` to import from JSON (reduced from 173 to 15 lines)
- Verified data integrity and proper loading
- Successfully achieved full content/framework separation for talks

### 3. Publications System Improvements

#### 3.1 Removed Unused "hide" Field
- Identified `hide` field as unused legacy code (never used in data)
- Removed from TypeScript type in `/lib/publications-data.ts`
- Removed filter logic from publications page
- Removed from PublicationCard component interface
- Cleaned up codebase by removing dead code

#### 3.2 Author Configuration System
- Created `/apps/web/content/publications/metadata.json` with:
  - `selfName`: "C.F. Park" (no longer hardcoded in component)
  - `authorLinks`: Links for 34 coauthors
- Initially implemented clickable author links functionality
- Later removed the links feature per request (kept metadata for future use)
- System now uses configurable `selfName` from metadata instead of hardcoded value

#### 3.3 Data Cleanup
- Fixed typo: "F.V. Navarro" ‚Üí "F. Villaescusa-Navarro" in publications.json
- Collected homepage and Google Scholar links for 34 coauthors
- Links collected include personal websites, Google Scholar profiles, and institutional pages

### 4. Architecture Benefits Achieved
- **True content/framework separation**: 
  - Publications: Edit `/content/publications/` only
  - Talks: Edit `/content/talks/` only
  - Blog: Edit `/content/blog/` only
  - Projects: Edit `/content/projects/` only
  - News: Edit `/content/news/` only
- **Reusable framework**: Others can fork and replace content directories
- **Configuration-driven**: Author detection and settings in content, not code
- **Type safety**: Maintained TypeScript types throughout migration

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/apps/web/content/talks/talks.json` - 19 talks data
- `/apps/web/content/publications/metadata.json` - Author configuration
- `/apps/web/lib/talks-data.ts.backup` - Backup before migration
- `/claude_notes/logs/2025-08-26/16-40_content_audit_and_data_migration.md` - This log

### Modified
- `/CONTENT_AUDIT.md` - Updated with current architecture state
- `/apps/web/lib/talks-data.ts` - Now imports from JSON
- `/apps/web/lib/publications-data.ts` - Removed hide field, added metadata import
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/publications/page.tsx` - Updated to pass selfName
- `/apps/web/components/publication-card.tsx` - Uses configurable selfName
- `/apps/web/content/publications/publications.json` - Fixed F.V. Navarro typo

## Technical Decisions
1. **Removed author links feature**: Wasn't working, kept metadata for future use
2. **Kept selfName configurable**: Better than hardcoding "C.F. Park"
3. **Removed hide field**: YAGNI principle - unused feature adding complexity
4. **JSON over TypeScript**: Better separation, easier for non-developers to edit

## Migration Status Summary
- ‚úÖ **Fully Migrated**: Blog, Projects, News, Publications, Talks
- ‚ùå **Still Hardcoded**: CV page, Home page
- üîÑ **Future Work**: Could migrate CV and Home page data to content directory

## Notes
- Portal app (Orchestra) exists as separate Next.js application in `/apps/portal/`
- Beta blog system includes password protection via API route
- All content systems now follow consistent JSON/MDX pattern
- Website is now truly modular - content can be replaced without touching framework code
