# Google OAuth Integration for Portal App

## Date: 2025-08-26, 14:50

## Summary
Analyzed the portal app architecture, implemented Google OAuth authentication alongside existing email/password auth, added logout functionality, and guided through complete Google Cloud Platform setup for OAuth credentials.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Portal App Architecture Analysis
- Examined the complete structure of the portal app created earlier
- Reviewed authentication flow with Supabase
- Analyzed routing structure:
  - `/` - Homepage (authenticated users dashboard)
  - `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup` - Authentication pages
  - `/[project_slug]` - Private project pages
  - `/[project_slug]/s/[token]` - Public share links
- Confirmed email/password authentication was functional

### 2. Google OAuth Implementation

**Added OAuth functionality to auth pages**:
- Modified `/app/auth/login/page.tsx`:
  - Added `handleGoogleLogin` function using `signInWithOAuth`
  - Added Google sign-in button with official Google logo SVG
  - Updated UI to show "Or continue with" divider

- Modified `/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`:
  - Added `handleGoogleSignup` function
  - Added matching Google sign-up button
  - Consistent UI with login page

**Created OAuth callback handler**:
- Created `/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- Handles OAuth code exchange for session
- Redirects to homepage after successful authentication

### 3. Logout Functionality
- Created `/components/logout-button.tsx` component
- Added logout button to homepage header
- Displays user email next to logout button
- Uses `supabase.auth.signOut()` for session termination

### 4. Google Cloud Platform Setup Guidance

**Guided through complete GCP setup**:
1. Creating new Google Cloud project
2. Configuring OAuth consent screen:
   - External audience selection
   - App name: "Research Portal"
   - Basic configuration without optional fields
3. Creating OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Web application type
   - Named "Research Portal"
   - Added Supabase callback URL as authorized redirect URI
4. Integrating with Supabase:
   - Added Client ID and Secret to Supabase provider settings
   - Confirmed callback URL configuration

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env.example` with OAuth setup instructions
- Added comments for Google OAuth configuration steps
- Specified redirect URLs for local and production environments

## Technical Details

### OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Redirected to Google's OAuth consent
3. After authorization, redirected to `/auth/callback`
4. Callback exchanges code for session
5. User redirected to portal homepage

### Security Considerations
- Kept nonce check enabled (recommended security practice)
- OAuth tokens handled server-side via Supabase
- Session management through secure cookies

## Files Modified
- `apps/portal/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Added Google OAuth button and handler
- `apps/portal/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Added Google OAuth button and handler  
- `apps/portal/app/page.tsx` - Added logout button and user email display
- `apps/portal/.env.example` - Added OAuth setup instructions

## Files Created
- `apps/portal/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback handler
- `apps/portal/components/logout-button.tsx` - Logout button component

## Testing Results
- Email/password authentication: ✅ Working
- Google OAuth authentication: ✅ Successfully tested and working
- Logout functionality: ✅ Working
- User successfully authenticated via Google and accessed portal

## Next Steps Discussed
- Email template customization in Supabase (for branding)
- Custom SMTP configuration for branded emails
- Potential production deployment considerations

## Notes
- Portal runs on port 3021
- Supabase project already configured with valid credentials
- Google Cloud project in testing mode (suitable for development)
- Authentication system fully functional with both email and OAuth options
