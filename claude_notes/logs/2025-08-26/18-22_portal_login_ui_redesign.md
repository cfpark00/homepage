# Portal Login UI Redesign

## Date: 2025-08-26, 18:22

## Summary
Redesigned the Research Portal login page with a split-screen layout featuring functional floating public research links on desktop and mobile-friendly alternatives. Updated documentation for consistency and fixed Next.js 15 params await issues.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Documentation Updates
- Updated SHADCN_TIPS.md to reflect actual configuration:
  - Changed `baseColor` from "neutral" to "zinc"
  - Added missing config fields (`rsc: true`, `cssVariables: true`)
  - Updated config path from `.js` to `.ts`
  - Kept component list as examples (not meant to be exhaustive)

### 2. Portal Login Page Redesign
- **Split-screen layout implementation:**
  - Left side: Login form with card styling
  - Right side: Interactive gradient panel with floating public research links
  - Mobile: Full-width login form with separate button for exploring public shares

- **Header changes:**
  - Updated to "Core's Research Portal"
  - Subtitle: "Workspace for collaboration, research tracking and sharing."
  - Center-aligned with card below

- **Right panel features:**
  - Purple-pink gradient background
  - 8 floating public research project links with glass morphism effect
  - Two functional links with actual routes:
    - `/neural-scaling/s/demo123` - Neural Scaling Laws research
    - `/quantum-computing/s/xyz789` - Quantum Computing simulations
  - "Explore all public research →" button in bottom-right corner
  - Adjusted positioning to prevent cards being cut off at viewport edges

### 3. Mobile Experience Enhancements
- Removed "View demo links" (kept `/test` page as hidden developer feature)
- Added gradient-colored "Explore all public research →" button below login card
- Created `/explore` page showing public projects in card grid layout
- Mobile users can access public shares through dedicated button

### 4. Technical Fixes
- **Next.js 15 params await issue:**
  - Changed params type to `Promise<{ project_slug: string; token: string }>`
  - Added proper await and destructuring
  - Fixed all references to use destructured values

- **Dynamic content for shared pages:**
  - Made project titles and findings dynamic based on project slug
  - Neural Scaling and Quantum Computing show unique content
  - Fallback for unknown projects auto-generates title from slug

### 5. File Structure Changes
- Created: `/apps/portal/app/auth/login/login-right-side-backup.tsx` (backup of original geometric shapes design)
- Created: `/apps/portal/app/explore/page.tsx` (mobile-friendly public shares page)

## Key Design Decisions
- Kept login functionality prominent while showcasing public research
- Made public shares accessible on all devices with appropriate UI patterns
- Maintained visual consistency with gradient themes across desktop/mobile
- Balanced aesthetic appeal with functional access to public content

## Files Modified
- `/apps/portal/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Complete redesign with split-screen layout
- `/apps/portal/app/[project_slug]/s/[token]/page.tsx` - Fixed params await and dynamic content
- `/apps/portal/app/explore/page.tsx` - New page for mobile public shares browsing
- `/claude_notes/docs/ui_and_styling/SHADCN_TIPS.md` - Updated configuration accuracy

## Next Steps/Recommendations
- Consider implementing actual authentication for the Terms and Privacy Policy links
- Add real public research projects to replace placeholder links
- Implement share token generation system for actual project sharing
- Consider adding search/filter functionality to the explore page
