# Portal Navigation Removal and Deployment

## Date: 2025-08-26, 22:13

## Summary
Removed the Portal navigation link from the web app since the portal is still under construction, fixed TypeScript errors, and deployed the changes to production.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Portal Navigation Analysis
- **Searched for all navigation paths from web to portal app**
- Found exactly 1 navigation method: the Portal link in the header navigation
- Located in `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx`
- Appeared in both desktop and mobile navigation menus as an external link

### 2. Portal Link Removal
- **Removed Portal entry from navigation array**:
  - Deleted the Portal navigation item with conditional dev/production URLs
  - Removed external link logic since no external links remain
  - Simplified navigation mapping to only render internal Next.js Links
  - Removed unused `ExternalLink` icon import from lucide-react

### 3. TypeScript Error Fixes
- **Fixed type errors in navigation component**:
  - Removed conditional checks for `item.external` property
  - Simplified both desktop and mobile navigation rendering
  - All navigation items now use consistent Link component
  - Successfully passed `pnpm type-check`

### 4. Build Verification
- **Ran `pnpm build` from root**:
  - Both apps built successfully
  - Web app: 28 static pages generated
  - Portal app: 9 pages generated
  - No build errors or warnings

### 5. Deployment
- **Git operations**:
  - Added modified navigation component
  - Committed with descriptive message about Portal removal
  - Pushed to main branch
- **Automatic deployment triggered via Vercel Git integration**

## Files Modified
- `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx`: Removed Portal link and simplified navigation logic

## Rationale
The portal app needs more development before being publicly accessible. Removing the navigation link prevents users from accessing an incomplete application while allowing continued development without public exposure.

## Next Steps
- Continue portal app development without public access
- Re-add Portal navigation when the app is ready for production use
