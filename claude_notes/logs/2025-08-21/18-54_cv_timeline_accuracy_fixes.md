# CV Timeline View Accuracy Fixes Log
**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Time:** 18:54  
**Project:** CV Timeline and Traditional View Content Verification

## Summary
Verified and corrected CV content in both Timeline and Traditional views against actual data from `/resources/sections/` files to ensure accuracy and eliminate hallucinated or speculative content.

## Major Tasks Completed

### 1. Timeline View Analysis and Fixes
- **Identified Issues**:
  - Hallucinated milestone events (speculative NeurIPS and Nature Methods dates)
  - Incorrect education periods (Ph.D. showing as "Present" instead of "2025")
  - Missing advisor names and thesis titles
  - Unclear start/end date indicators

- **Corrections Made**:
  - Updated Ph.D. period to "2019 - 2025" with correct thesis title
  - Fixed advisor list to match actual LaTeX files
  - Added Postdoctoral Fellow position starting May 2025
  - Corrected NTT Research internship periods (Jan 2025, Jul-Sep 2024)
  - Research Assistant period: Jun 2020 - May 2025

### 2. Timeline Component Improvements
- **parseYear Function Enhancement**:
  - Added support for parsing end years from period strings
  - Handles formats like "2019 - 2025", "2019 - Present", "Jan 2025, Jul 2024 - Sep 2024"
  
- **Event Labeling**:
  - Added clear prefixes: "Completed:", "Started:", "Current:"
  - Education events use end year for completed degrees
  - Experience events use start year for positions
  
- **Milestone Events**:
  - Replaced speculative events with actual achievements:
    - NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight (December 2024)
    - Nature Methods Publication (January 2024)
    - Ph.D. Defense (April 2025)

### 3. Traditional View Content Verification
- **Awards Section**:
  - Added missing: Best Machine Learning Project Award - KIAS (2019)
  - Corrected: Best Project Award Physics Winter Camp - KIAS (2018)
  - Fixed year ranges: Purcell Fellowship (2019-2020), Presidential Scholarship (2015-2019)
  
- **Skills Reorganization**:
  - ML/AI Research: LLMs, RL, In-Context Learning, Compositional Generalization
  - Programming: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, SQL, MATLAB, Julia
  - Computational: Real-time DAQ, HPC, GPU Computing, Cache Optimization
  - Data Analysis: Fourier Analysis, Time Series Filtering, Bayesian Inference
  - DevOps: Full Product Building, Frontend/Backend, VM, Kubernetes
  - Experimental: Hardware Control, Experiment Automation, PID Control, Lab Optics
  
- **Languages Update**:
  - Korean (Native), English (Native)
  - French (Semi-Native - TCF C1/C2)
  - Spanish (Novice)

### 4. PDF Download Verification
- Confirmed `/CFPark_CV.pdf` exists in `/apps/web/public/`
- Verified it will work correctly when deployed to Vercel
- Static file serving through Next.js public directory

## Files Modified
1. `/apps/web/app/(default)/cv/page.tsx` - Updated CV data object
2. `/apps/web/components/cv-timeline.tsx` - Fixed timeline logic and events
3. Both timeline and traditional views now accurately reflect actual CV data

## Data Sources Verified Against
- `/resources/sections/education.tex`
- `/resources/sections/employment.tex`
- `/resources/sections/publications.tex`
- `/resources/sections/awards.tex`
- `/resources/sections/skills.tex`
- `/resources/sections/languages.tex`
- `/apps/web/lib/publications-data.ts`

## Quality Assurance
- All hallucinated content removed
- Dates and periods verified against source documents
- Clear indication of start vs. end dates in timeline
- Consistent data between timeline and traditional views
- No speculative achievements or positions

## Next Steps
- Website is ready for deployment with accurate CV information
- Both CV views (Timeline and Traditional) display verified content
- PDF download functionality confirmed for production environment
