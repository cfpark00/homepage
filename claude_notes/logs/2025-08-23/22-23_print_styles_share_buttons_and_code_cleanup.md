# Print Styles, Share Buttons, and Code Cleanup

## Date: 2025-08-23 22:23

## Summary
Implemented print-specific styles for interactive demos, added share functionality to blog posts, refactored publication cards to eliminate code duplication, and cleaned up unused code.

## Major Changes

### 1. Print Styles for Interactive Demos
- Created print-specific CSS that replaces interactive components with `[INTERACTIVE DEMO]` placeholder
- Implemented solution using inline `<style>` tags in the Random Walk component
- Removed all global print styles to keep them component-specific
- Ensures clean printing of blog posts with interactive content

### 2. Share Button Implementation
- Created reusable `ShareButton` component with toast notifications
- Added share buttons to:
  - Blog post cards (top-right corner)
  - Individual blog post pages (in metadata section)
- Integrated with existing `sonner` toast system for "Link copied!" feedback
- Used `Share2` icon from Lucide React

### 3. Publications System Refactoring
- Updated `PublicationCard` component to include all features:
  - Added PDF/Code buttons
  - Fixed padding issue (`pb-3`)
  - Corrected type colors and types
  - Fixed `target="_blank"` typo
- Refactored publications page to use the component (removed 150+ lines of duplicate code)
- Single source of truth for publication card rendering

### 4. UI Improvements
- Added Publications link card to CV page
- Reduced bottom padding on collapsed publication cards
- Improved blog card spacing and typography
- Updated blog post dates (random walks to 2025-08-23)
- Removed redundant UI text ("All Tags" heading)

### 5. Code Cleanup and Archiving
- Created `/archive/unused-code/` directory for obsolete components
- Archived:
  - `chat-box.tsx` - Component only referenced in commented code
  - `research-tools/` - Orphaned page directory not linked anywhere
- **Important lesson learned**: MDX files can import components directly, need to check MDX imports before removing components
- Restored accidentally moved documentation (claude_notes, resources, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Print Implementation
```tsx
// Component-scoped print styles in random-walk.tsx
<style>{`
  @media screen {
    .rw-print-placeholder {
      display: none !important;
    }
  }
  @media print {
    .rw-demo-container {
      display: none !important;
    }
    .rw-print-placeholder {
      display: block !important;
      /* styling */
    }
  }
`}</style>
```

### Share Button with Toast
```tsx
// Using sonner for toast notifications
import { toast } from "sonner"

const handleShare = async (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  await navigator.clipboard.writeText(fullUrl)
  toast.success("Link copied to clipboard!")
}
```

### PublicationCard Refactoring
- Unified interface for all publication types
- Component now handles journal, conference, workshop, thesis, preprint, book
- Consistent padding and styling across all usage

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Archiving Mistake
- Initially archived documentation folders (claude_notes, resources, etc.)
- User clarified: archive unused CODE, not documentation
- Restored all documentation immediately

### 2. MDX Import Discovery
- `research-flow.tsx` appeared unused by grep search
- Build failed - component was imported by MDX file
- Lesson: MDX files can import components directly, need special checking

### 3. Print Styles Challenge
- Initial attempts with global CSS didn't work properly
- Inline styles had specificity issues
- Solution: Component-scoped `<style>` tags worked perfectly

## Files Modified

### Created
- `/apps/web/components/share-button.tsx`
- `/archive/unused-code/` directory

### Modified
- `/apps/web/app/globals.css` - Removed all print styles
- `/apps/web/components/publication-card.tsx` - Complete refactor with all features
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/publications/page.tsx` - Now uses PublicationCard component
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/blog/page.tsx` - Added share buttons, improved spacing
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added share button
- `/apps/web/components/cv-traditional.tsx` - Added Publications link card
- `/apps/web/content/blog/random-walks-visualization/random-walk.tsx` - Added print styles
- `/apps/web/lib/blog.ts` - Updated dates

### Archived
- `/apps/web/components/chat-box.tsx` → `/archive/unused-code/`
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/research-tools/` → `/archive/unused-code/`

## Next Steps
- Monitor if any other unused components can be archived
- Consider implementing print styles for other interactive components if added
- Could extend share functionality to other pages if needed

## Git Commit
Created commit with message: "Add print styles for interactive demos and various UI improvements"
- Implemented before major refactoring to preserve stable state
- Second major refactor (PublicationCard) completed after commit
