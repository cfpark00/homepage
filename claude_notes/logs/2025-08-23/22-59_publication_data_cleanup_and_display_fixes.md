# Publication Data Cleanup and Display Fixes

## Date: 2025-08-23 22:59

## Summary
Fixed publication data consistency issues and display logic in the publications system. Corrected venue naming, capitalization, type-color mapping, and significance flags to ensure proper visual presentation.

## Major Activities

### 1. Publication Data Location
- Located publication data in `/apps/web/lib/publications-data.ts`
- Identified the Publication type definition and data array structure
- Found the rendering logic in `/apps/web/components/publication-card.tsx`

### 2. Venue Consistency Fixes
- Changed venue from "preprint" to "arXiv" for publications with arxiv links (IDs 1, 2)
- Fixed capitalization from "arxiv" to "arXiv" across all 4 arxiv publications
- Ensured consistent display for preprint sources

### 3. Publication Card Color Logic Fix
- Discovered that side colors were incorrectly tied to `significant` flag
- Fixed the logic to always show type-based colors for all publications:
  - Blue for journals
  - Green for conferences
  - Amber/yellow for preprints (including arXiv)
  - Purple for workshops, theses, and books
- Changed `highlightColor={pub.significant ? typeColor : undefined}` to `highlightColor={typeColor}`

### 4. Significance Flag Corrections
- Initially misunderstood the purpose of the significant flag
- Removed incorrect `significant: true` flags from:
  - "Humanity's last exam" (ID 8)
  - "mEMbrain" journal paper (ID 23)
  - "Revisiting Latent-Space Interpolation" (ID 24)
- Added `significant: true` to "In-Context Learning Strategies Emerge Rationally" (ID 7)

### 5. Data Type Clarifications
- Confirmed that publication `type` field only accepts: "journal", "conference", "preprint", "book", "thesis"
- Noted that `venue` field is displayed directly in the UI (not the type)
- Type field controls the color coding when displayed

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/apps/web/lib/publications-data.ts` - Updated venue names, capitalization, and significance flags
- `/apps/web/components/publication-card.tsx` - Fixed color display logic

### Key Changes
- 4 venue updates from "preprint" or "arxiv" to "arXiv" 
- 1 logic fix in publication-card.tsx for color display
- Multiple significance flag corrections

## Notes
- The publication system uses a hybrid approach with data in TypeScript files rather than content directory
- Colors now consistently display based on publication type for all entries
- The significant flag is preserved for other potential uses but no longer affects color display
