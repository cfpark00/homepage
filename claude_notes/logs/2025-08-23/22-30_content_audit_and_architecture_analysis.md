# Content Audit and Architecture Analysis

## Date: 2025-08-23 22:30

## Summary
Performed comprehensive audit of the website's content architecture, analyzing the separation between framework code and content data. Created detailed documentation of the current state and migration recommendations.

## Major Activities

### 1. Initial Content Audit
- Examined the `/apps/web/app` directory structure
- Identified pages with hardcoded content vs. those using content directory
- Discovered mixed approaches across different sections

### 2. Framework Analysis
- Analyzed blog and projects systems which use clean framework/content separation
- Examined the MDX-based content loading system in `/lib/blog.ts` and `/lib/projects.ts`
- Investigated the metadata.json pattern for content management

### 3. Content Directory Deep Dive
- Explored `/content/blog/` structure with MDX files and metadata
- Examined `/content/projects/` with interactive components (research-flow.tsx)
- Reviewed `/content/news/` JSON-based chronological organization

### 4. Hybrid Systems Investigation
- Found Publications and Talks data in `/lib` TypeScript files
- These systems are halfway migrated (data separated but not in content directory)
- Both use TypeScript data files: `publications-data.ts` and `talks-data.ts`

### 5. Hardcoded Content Identification
Found several pages with inline data:
- CV page with complex inline data structure
- Ongoing Projects page with hardcoded project array
- Research Tools page with inline research projects
- Home page with all content hardcoded

### 6. Documentation Creation
Created comprehensive `CONTENT_AUDIT.md` at root level with:
- Detailed breakdown of each content system
- Clear categorization (Fully Migrated, Hybrid, Hardcoded)
- File structure diagrams
- Migration recommendations with priorities
- Summary table of all content types

## Key Findings

1. **Successful Pattern**: Blog and Projects demonstrate excellent content/framework separation using:
   - Generic loaders in `/lib`
   - Content in `/content` with metadata.json
   - MDX support for interactive components

2. **Inconsistency**: Some systems (Publications, Talks) are partially migrated with data in `/lib` but not in `/content`

3. **Opportunity**: The existing blog/projects framework could easily be extended to other content types

4. **Interactive Content**: MDX successfully supports React components (random-walk.tsx, research-flow.tsx) within content files

## Files Created/Modified
- Created: `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/CONTENT_AUDIT.md` - Comprehensive audit document

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Complete migration of Publications and Talks to content directory
2. Migrate simple hardcoded pages (Ongoing Projects, Research Tools)
3. Consider restructuring CV page for content separation
4. Standardize all content systems to use the blog/projects pattern

## Technical Notes
- The metadata.json pattern provides TypeScript type safety while keeping content separate
- MDX dynamic loading is handled by `/components/mdx-content.tsx`
- Content framework is scalable and could support additional content types
