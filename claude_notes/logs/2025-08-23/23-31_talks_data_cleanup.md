# Talks Data Cleanup

## Date: 2025-08-23 23:31

## Summary
Cleaned up the talks data structure by removing unused fields and simplifying the display logic. Analyzed field usage in the talks page and removed redundant metadata fields to streamline the data model.

## Major Activities

### 1. Content Audit Analysis
- User opened CONTENT_AUDIT.md to review the site structure
- Examined the talks page implementation and data structure
- Located talks data in `/apps/web/lib/talks-data.ts`
- Identified Talk type definition with multiple metadata fields

### 2. Field Usage Analysis
Analyzed which fields were actually used in the talks page display:
- **`id`**: USED - for tracking expanded states and special styling logic (lines 144-147)
- **`year`**: NOT USED - redundant since we have `date` field
- **`type`**: NOT USED - conference/seminar/workshop types not referenced
- **`featured`**: NOT USED - no display logic based on this flag
- **`description`**: USED - displayed when talk card is expanded
- **`duration`**: USED - shown with clock icon in the UI
- **`primaryContent`**: RARELY USEFUL - only matters when both video and slides exist

### 3. Data Structure Cleanup
Removed unused fields from Talk type and all data entries:
- Removed `year` field (redundant with date)
- Removed `type` field (not used in display)
- Removed `featured` field (not used in display)
- Removed `primaryContent` field (simplified to always show slides first)

### 4. Display Logic Simplification
- Updated talks page to always show slides before video when both exist
- Removed conditional logic based on `primaryContent` field
- Simplified the thumbnail fallback icon (always shows presentation icon)
- Maintained consistent behavior across all talks

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `/apps/web/lib/talks-data.ts`:
   - Updated Talk type definition to remove unused fields
   - Cleaned up all talk entries to remove unused field values

2. `/apps/web/app/(default)/talks/page.tsx`:
   - Simplified media display logic to always show slides first
   - Removed primaryContent-based conditional rendering
   - Updated thumbnail placeholder logic

### Final Talk Type Structure
```typescript
export type Talk = {
  id: number           // Used for expansion tracking
  title: string
  venue: string
  date: string
  description?: string // Shown when expanded
  videoUrl?: string
  slidesUrl?: string
  thumbnailUrl?: string
  duration?: string    // Shown with clock icon
}
```

## Impact
- Cleaner, more maintainable data structure
- Reduced complexity in the display logic
- Consistent behavior for all talks with both video and slides
- Removed ~40 lines of redundant data across all talk entries
