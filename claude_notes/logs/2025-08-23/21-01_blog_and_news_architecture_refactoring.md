# Session Log: Blog and News Architecture Refactoring
**Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Time:** 21:01  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  

## Summary
Major refactoring of blog and news systems to improve content management and separation of concerns.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Blog System Analysis
- Explored the three-layer blog architecture:
  - Framework layer (`/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`)
  - Content layer (`/content/blog/*/`)
  - Metadata layer (`/lib/blog.ts`)
- Documented blog system in `/claude_notes/docs/blog-system-architecture.md`
- Confirmed separation of concerns: metadata controls visibility without deleting content

### 2. News System Refactoring
**Initial State:** Single 500+ line file with hardcoded news items in `/news/page.tsx`

**Refactoring Steps:**
1. **Separated content from code**
   - Moved all news items to JSON files
   - Created `/lib/news.ts` for data loading
   - Reduced page component to ~56 lines

2. **Implemented markdown support**
   - Replaced complex link array system with standard markdown `[text](url)` format
   - Added simple regex-based markdown renderer
   - Made content more human-readable and editable

3. **Organized by year and season**
   - Created structure: `/content/news/YYYY/[0-3]season.json`
   - Season mapping:
     - 0winter: Jan, Feb, Mar
     - 1spring: Apr, May, Jun
     - 2summer: Jul, Aug, Sep
     - 3fall: Oct, Nov, Dec
   - Created empty season files for consistency
   - Total: 73 news items preserved across 12 years

### 3. Content Verification
- Cloned repo to temp directory
- Checked out earlier commit (b482847)
- Verified all 73 news items preserved
- Confirmed content integrity with markdown enhancement

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `/claude_notes/docs/blog-system-architecture.md` - Blog system documentation
- `/apps/web/lib/news.ts` - News data loading library
- `/apps/web/content/news/` - Complete directory structure with year/season organization
- 48 JSON files (12 years Ã— 4 seasons)

### Modified:
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/news/page.tsx` - Refactored to use external data
- Blog pages received minor updates from linter (spacing adjustments)

### Deleted:
- Original monolithic news data from page component
- Temporary migration scripts

## Architecture Improvements

### News System Benefits:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Content, logic, and presentation separated
2. **Human-Readable**: JSON with markdown links, no TypeScript knowledge needed
3. **Organized**: Year/season structure for easy navigation
4. **Maintainable**: Small files (1-9 items each) vs single 500+ line file
5. **Git-Friendly**: Changes isolated to specific seasons

### Blog vs News Comparison:
| Aspect | Blog | News |
|--------|------|------|
| Content Format | MDX | JSON with markdown |
| Architecture | 3-layer | 2-layer |
| Dynamic Features | Yes (components) | No |
| Publishing Control | Metadata layer | Direct file editing |

## Technical Details

- Used filesystem-based loading at build time
- Maintained Next.js static generation
- No runtime performance impact
- Automatic sorting by date (newest first)
- Graceful handling of missing seasons

## Notes
- User requested specific season ordering (0winter first for chronological year flow)
- All content verified against previous commits - no data loss
- System supports easy addition of new news items by editing JSON files
