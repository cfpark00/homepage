# Origins of Representations Project Overview Population

## Date: 2025-08-29, 04:01

## Summary
Conducted comprehensive interview with user to populate complete project overview for "origins-representations" project, added research papers with proper abstracts, documented planning conversation in thoughts, and created reusable instructions for future AI agents.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Project Overview Interview and Creation
- **Conducted structured interview** to gather project information:
  - Research question: "What are the conditions which form these representations in the first place?"
  - Focus on understanding when representations form modularly vs fractured/scattered
  - Synthetic data approach using PCFGs and HHMMs
- **Created comprehensive overview.json** at `/apps/portal/content/projects/origins-representations/overview.json`:
  - Proposal abstract describing research focus
  - 4 milestones (no dates per user preference)
  - 5 core experiments including scaling analysis
  - Resource requirements (1-2 students, 8 GPUs/student, 1TB storage/student)
  - Detailed proposal with all required sections
  - Potential objections and responses

### 2. Literature Management
- **Added two key papers to items.json** with full abstracts from arXiv:
  1. "Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning" (Core Francisco Park et al., December 2024)
  2. "Analyzing (In)Abilities of SAEs via Formal Languages" (Abhinav Menon et al., October 2024)
- **Used WebFetch** to retrieve exact abstracts from arXiv
- **Followed proper formatting** per `/claude_notes/docs/portal_projects/adding_literature.md`:
  - Real abstracts (not summaries)
  - "Month Year" date format
  - Complete author lists
  - Proper relevance descriptions
- **Removed deprecated literature.json** file after migrating to items.json

### 3. Project Thoughts Documentation
- **Added 8 comprehensive thought entries** to `/apps/portal/content/projects/origins-representations/thoughts.json`:
  - Research question crystallization
  - Methodology decisions (PCFG/HHMM)
  - Core hypotheses about modularity
  - Literature additions
  - Reviewer challenges and responses
  - Milestones and resource planning
  - Ultimate goals and impact
- **Queried real time** (03:55) before adding thoughts
- **Applied appropriate tags** for each thought entry

### 4. Created Reusable Instructions
- **Wrote comprehensive guide** at `/claude_notes/jobs/populate_project_overview.txt`:
  - 8-phase interview process
  - Required reading documents (literature guidelines, thought writing)
  - Data structure requirements
  - Interview best practices
  - Quality checklist
  - Example interview flow
- **Included critical steps**:
  - Reading `/claude_notes/docs/portal_projects/adding_literature.md`
  - Reading `/claude_notes/jobs/thought_writing.txt`
  - Querying current time before adding thoughts
  - Using WebFetch for real abstracts

## Key Insights

### Research Focus
- Moving beyond finding representations to understanding their genesis
- Synthetic data provides tractability for causality studies
- Scaling relationships more important than absolute modularity

### Methodological Decisions
- PCFGs and HHMMs chosen for controllable structure
- Trade-off: simplicity vs real-world applicability
- Justification: can't do proper causality with models trained once on real data

### Interview Process Learnings
- One question at a time approach works well
- Users may not have all details (e.g., dates) - that's fine
- Build on responses for clarification
- Document reasoning behind decisions in thoughts

## Files Modified
- Created: `/apps/portal/content/projects/origins-representations/overview.json`
- Modified: `/apps/portal/content/projects/origins-representations/items.json`
- Modified: `/apps/portal/content/projects/origins-representations/thoughts.json`
- Created: `/claude_notes/jobs/populate_project_overview.txt`
- Removed: `/apps/portal/content/projects/origins-representations/literature.json` (deprecated)

## Next Steps
- User can use the created instructions to populate other project overviews
- Origins-representations project now has complete overview ready for portal display
- Literature properly formatted with real abstracts for academic integrity
