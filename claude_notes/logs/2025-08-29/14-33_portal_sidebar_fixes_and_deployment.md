# Portal Sidebar Fixes and Deployment Management

## Date: 2025-08-29, 14:33

## Summary
Fixed critical portal sidebar persistence issues by restructuring the app layout, handled deployment failures and rollbacks, and established proper testing procedures before pushing to production.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Thought Tracking System Management
- **Added multiple thoughts to August 29:**
  - 03:01 - Designing project overview page
  - 03:26 - Adding the context to weights project (corrected time from initial 03:02)
  - 03:37 - Added some old project ideas I had
  - 03:50 - Now populating all overview content
  - 04:01 - Creating structure workflow jobs for Claude
  - 04:14 - Populating origins of representations and domain ablated LLMs projects
  - 04:38 - Populating Evolution of research project
  - 04:58 - Done with 3 overviews
  - 05:04 - Done with cleaning stuff up
- **Fixed timestamp tracking:** Ensured current time is queried before adding entries
- **Corrected mistaken entry:** Removed incorrectly added thought from August 27

### 2. Portal Sidebar Persistence Issues
- **Identified problems:**
  - Sidebar scroll position reset on navigation
  - Icon components flashing when switching projects
  - Root cause: Each page wrapped with its own `PortalLayoutSimple` instance
  
- **Implemented solution:**
  - Created shared `(dashboard)` layout group in `/apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
  - Moved sidebar to persistent parent layout
  - Removed `PortalLayoutSimple` wrapper from individual pages
  - Restructured pages into dashboard group:
    - `/apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` (home)
    - `/apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/[project_slug]/page.tsx` (projects)

### 3. Deployment Issues and Recovery
- **Initial deployment sequence:**
  - Fixed TypeScript regex flag compatibility (ES2018 `s` flag issue)
  - Successfully ran type-check and build
  - Committed and pushed changes

- **Critical failures:**
  - Attempted to use real project data in dashboard stats
  - Pushed without testing, breaking production
  - Created redirect loop with root page redirecting to itself (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`)
  
- **Recovery actions:**
  - Immediately reverted breaking commit with `git revert HEAD`
  - Removed problematic redirect page causing infinite loop
  - Verified builds before pushing fixes
  - Restored working state with hardcoded dashboard values

### 4. File Structure Changes
- **Added:**
  - `/apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/` - New route group for persistent layout
  - `/apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Shared layout with sidebar
  - `/apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` - Dashboard home page
  - `/apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/[project_slug]/page.tsx` - Project pages
  
- **Removed:**
  - `/apps/portal/app/[project_slug]/` - Old project route structure
  - `/apps/portal/app/page.tsx` - Removed to fix redirect loop

### 5. Lessons Learned
- **Never push untested code to production**
- **Always run `pnpm build` before committing changes**
- **Understand data flow and architectural implications before refactoring**
- **Test locally first, especially for layout and routing changes**
- **Have rollback strategy ready for production issues**

## Technical Details

### Sidebar Fix Implementation
```tsx
// Created shared layout at /apps/portal/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
// This persists the sidebar across all dashboard routes
export default async function DashboardLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  // Authentication and data fetching
  // Return PortalLayoutSimple wrapping children
}
```

### Build Commands Used
```bash
pnpm type-check  # Verify TypeScript types
pnpm build       # Build both apps
git revert HEAD  # Emergency rollback
```

## Final Status
- ✅ Portal sidebar now persists scroll position and doesn't flash
- ✅ Both apps building successfully
- ✅ Production deployment working
- ✅ Established proper testing workflow before deployment
