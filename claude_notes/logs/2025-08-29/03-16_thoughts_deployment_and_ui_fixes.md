# Thoughts System, Deployment, and UI/UX Fixes

## Date: 2025-08-29, 03:16

## Summary
Managed thoughts tracking throughout the day, successfully deployed both web and portal apps after removing sensitive data, audited and fixed UI/UX flash issues, and improved navigation responsive behavior.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Thoughts Tracking System
- **Added multiple thought entries for August 29:**
  - 00:02 - Consolidating papers instead of keeping browser tabs
  - 00:21 - Frustration with too many Chrome tabs
  - 00:27 - Claude hallucinating abstracts issue
  - 01:46 - Organizing research thoughts
  - 02:25 - Finished paper organization with prompt engineering
  - 02:29 - Deploying web/portal
  - 03:01 - Designing project overview page
- **Titled August 28 thoughts:** "FER paper, portal thoughts, project discussions, synthetic data"
- **Created new August 29 thoughts file** with "Ongoing..." title

### 2. Deployment Process
- **Fixed type errors:** Added missing `tags` property to ProjectTabs interface
- **Built successfully:** Both web and portal apps passed build
- **Handled security issue:**
  - Initial push blocked due to Google OAuth credentials in resources folder
  - Removed sensitive resources directory completely
  - Updated .gitignore to exclude resources folder
  - Successfully deployed after cleaning sensitive data

### 3. UI/UX Improvements

#### Flash/Loading Issues Audit
- **Audited entire codebase for flash issues from TODO.md**
- **Found most issues already fixed:**
  - thoughts-client.tsx ✅ (has isLoading state)
  - beta-password-guard.tsx ✅ (has isLoading state)
  - Theme switching ✅ (properly configured with next-themes)
- **Fixed font-size-selector.tsx:**
  - Changed from useEffect to state initializer pattern
  - Prevents flash from default to saved font size
  - Applied fix to both FontSizeSelector and FontSizeButtonGroup

#### Navigation Responsive Improvements
- **Fixed text wrapping:** Added `whitespace-nowrap` to "Core Francisco Park"
- **Adjusted breakpoint:** Changed from md (768px) to custom min-[960px]
  - Prevents overflow of theme toggle button
  - Shows hamburger menu up to 960px
  - Provides better spacing for all navigation items

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **Updated TODO.md:** 
  - Marked completed items
  - Reorganized into completed vs remaining work
  - Clarified most concerns already addressed
- **Deleted obsolete TODO.md** from todos directory

## Files Modified
- `/apps/web/components/font-size-selector.tsx` - Fixed localStorage flash
- `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` - Improved responsive behavior
- `/apps/portal/components/project-tabs.tsx` - Added tags property
- `.gitignore` - Added resources folder exclusion
- `/todos/TODO.md` - Deleted (was outdated)
- Multiple thought JSON files

## Key Decisions
1. **Custom breakpoint at 960px** - Better balance between mobile and desktop navigation
2. **State initializer pattern** - Prevents flash for localStorage-based preferences
3. **Removed sensitive resources** - Security best practice for public repositories

## Notes
- The TODO list concerns were mostly already addressed before audit
- Navigation now handles medium screen sizes much better
- Deployment process works smoothly with GitHub push protection enabled
