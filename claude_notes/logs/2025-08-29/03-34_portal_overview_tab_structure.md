# Portal Overview Tab Structure Implementation
**Date**: 2025-08-29
**Time**: 03:34
**Focus**: Creating structured overview tab for research projects in portal

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive overview tab structure for the portal's research project system, allowing detailed project proposals with multiple sections including abstract, milestones, experiments, resources, and detailed proposal information.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Created Overview Tab Component Structure
- Built `project-overview.tsx` component with structured sections:
  - Proposal Abstract
  - Detailed Proposal (collapsible)
  - Milestones
  - Core Experiments  
  - Expected Resources
- Implemented clean list-based UI with circle/check-circle indicators
- Added safety checks for empty/undefined data

### 2. UI Components Added
- Created `collapsible.tsx` component for Radix UI collapsible functionality
- Created `progress.tsx` component for progress bars (later removed per user preference)
- Built `simple-markdown.tsx` for basic markdown rendering in detailed proposals

### 3. Created Comprehensive Example Data
- Generated `overview.json` for example-research project with:
  - Full proposal abstract
  - 5 detailed milestones with status tracking
  - 5 core experiments with completion states
  - 6 resource requirements with allocation status
  - Complete detailed proposal with 6 subsections:
    - Background & Motivation
    - Related Research
    - Research Roadmap
    - Expected Results
    - Broader Impact
    - Potential Objections and Responses

### 4. Integration and Data Flow
- Updated `projects.ts` to load overview.json files
- Modified `project-tabs.tsx` to render ProjectOverview component
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implemented conditional rendering to handle empty overviews

### 5. UI Refinements
- Adjusted padding throughout (p-4 pb-3 for headers, p-4 pt-0 for content)
- Simplified milestones to clean list format (removed progress bars, dates, status badges)
- Converted core experiments to simple list with circle indicators
- Changed expected resources to match list style
- Moved Detailed Proposal between Abstract and Milestones for better flow

### 6. Bug Fixes
- Fixed runtime error for undefined arrays by adding safety checks
- Resolved empty overview display issue (was showing empty cards for {})
- Fixed LaTeX rendering in paper titles by removing special characters
- Corrected PROJECTS_DIR path issue that prevented projects from loading

## Files Created
- `/apps/portal/components/project-overview.tsx` - Main overview component
- `/apps/portal/components/simple-markdown.tsx` - Markdown renderer
- `/apps/portal/content/projects/example-research/overview.json` - Example data
- `/packages/ui/src/components/collapsible.tsx` - Collapsible UI component
- `/packages/ui/src/components/progress.tsx` - Progress bar component

## Files Modified
- `/apps/portal/components/project-tabs.tsx` - Integrated overview component
- `/apps/portal/lib/projects.ts` - Added overview loading logic
- `/apps/portal/content/projects/example-research/overview.json` - Adjusted experiment statuses
- `/apps/portal/content/projects/context-to-weights/items.json` - Cleaned LaTeX formatting

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture
The overview system uses a hierarchical component structure:
- `ProjectTabs` renders different tab content based on selection
- `ProjectOverview` handles the overview tab specifically
- `SimpleMarkdown` provides basic markdown formatting for text content

### Data Structure
Overview data follows this schema:
```typescript
{
  proposalAbstract: string
  milestones: Array<{
    id, title, description, targetDate, status, progress?
  }>
  coreExperiments: Array<{
    id, name, description, status, estimatedDuration?, results?
  }>
  expectedResources: Array<{
    type, description, quantity?, status?
  }>
  detailedProposal: {
    backgroundMotivation, relatedResearch, researchRoadmap,
    expectedResults, broaderImpact, potentialObjections
  }
}
```

### UI Design Decisions
- Used consistent circle/check-circle indicators for visual unity
- Removed complex status badges in favor of simple visual cues
- Implemented collapsible detailed proposal to reduce initial visual load
- Applied consistent spacing (p-4 pb-3) across all cards

## Issues Resolved
1. Projects not loading in sidebar - fixed incorrect PROJECTS_DIR path
2. Empty overview showing structure - added content existence checks
3. Markdown not rendering - created simple markdown component
4. Runtime errors with undefined arrays - added safety checks

## Next Steps Potential
- Add edit functionality for overview sections
- Implement markdown editor for detailed proposal
- Add timeline visualization for milestones
- Create templates for different project types
- Add export functionality for proposals
