# Phase Space Visualization Wrapping Fixes and Documentation Update

## Session Summary
Fixed aesthetic issues with phase space trajectory visualization, updated blog documentation to reflect the new visualizations, and made minor UI improvements to plot labels and axis ticks.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Phase Space Plot Wrapping Issues
- **Problem**: Vertical lines appeared when angles wrapped from π to -π (or vice versa)
- **Root Cause**: Angles weren't being wrapped to [-π, π] before plotting, causing polyline to connect distant points
- **Solution**: 
  - Wrap all angles to [-π, π] range before plotting
  - Detect discontinuities when wrapped angles jump > 3 radians
  - Break trajectory into separate polyline segments at wrap points
  - Applied same wrapping logic to current position markers

### 2. Updated Blog Documentation
Added comprehensive documentation for the new visualizations:

#### Phase Space Trajectories (Left Plot)
- Explained that it shows the configuration space (θ₁ vs θ₂)
- Described how colored trails reveal attractors and forbidden regions
- Emphasized how nearly identical starts lead to wildly different paths

#### Lyapunov Divergence (Right Plot)
- Clarified that it measures full 4D phase space distance (angles + velocities)
- Explained the three lines:
  - Orange: Actual measured divergence
  - Green: Random expected baseline (thermalized state)
  - Gray: Maximum possible given energy constraints
- Described how initial slope reveals Lyapunov exponent
- Explained saturation at random baseline

### 3. Added Key Insights Section
- Exponential divergence as hallmark of chaos
- Energy bounds providing fundamental limits
- Thermalization leading to uncorrelated motion
- Phase space structure revealing attractors

### 4. Updated Experiments Section
- Revised suggestions to match new visualizations
- Added note about single pendulum mode (phase space only)
- Emphasized observing divergence saturation at random baseline

### 5. Minor UI Improvements
- Split "Phase space distance" y-axis label into two lines for better readability
- Added tick marks on both axes of divergence plot:
  - Y-axis ticks at min/max positions (y=10, y=130)
  - X-axis ticks at start/end positions (x=30, x=330)
- Adjusted y-axis label position (x=8) to avoid overlap with tick labels
- Kept exponential notation labels for log scale on divergence plot
- Maintained π/-π labels on phase space plot axes

## Technical Details

### Wrapping Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// Detect wrapped angle jumps
if (Math.abs(angle1 - prevWrappedAngle1) > 3.0 || 
    Math.abs(angle2 - prevWrappedAngle2) > 3.0) {
  // Start new polyline segment
}
```
