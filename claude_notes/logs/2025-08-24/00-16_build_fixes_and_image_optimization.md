# Build Fixes and Image Optimization

## Date: 2025-08-24, 00:16

## Summary
Fixed critical build errors, optimized all images using Next.js Image component, and successfully deployed to production with zero warnings.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Initial Build Error Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript error in `talks-data.ts` by removing undefined properties:
  - Removed `year` property (line 67, 130, 170)
  - Removed `type` property (line 69, 132, 172)
  - Removed `featured` property (multiple occurrences)
- These properties were being used in data but not defined in the `Talk` type

### 2. Critical 404 Page Fix
- Build was failing with "Cannot find module for page: /_document" error
- Created `/apps/web/app/layout.tsx` (root layout)
- Created `/apps/web/app/not-found.tsx` (404 page)
- Fixed the Next.js app router structure issue

### 3. Complete Image Optimization
- Converted all `<img>` tags to Next.js `<Image>` components:
  - **Talk thumbnails** (biggest win - were 2-3MB PNGs displayed as 160x96px!)
  - Profile images (homepage and CV page)
  - Project card thumbnails
  - Simple page profile image
  - Flying publications component images
- Added proper error handling with `failedImages` state for graceful fallbacks
- Used `priority` prop for above-the-fold images

### 4. ESLint Warning Fixes
- Fixed React hooks cleanup warning in `cv-timeline.tsx`:
  - Changed from using `itemRefs.current` directly in cleanup
  - Now captures refs in a variable with proper TypeScript type guards
  - Used `filter((ref): ref is HTMLDivElement => ref !== null)`

### 5. Deployment
- Successfully deployed preview to Vercel
- Successfully deployed to production (www.corefranciscopark.com)
- Both deployments completed with zero errors or warnings

## Technical Details

### Performance Impact
- Talk thumbnails were the biggest optimization:
  - Before: Loading 2-3MB PNG files
  - After: Next.js automatically resizes and serves optimized WebP
  - Estimated 90%+ reduction in image payload

### Type Safety Improvements
- Fixed ref type issues with proper type predicates
- Removed undefined properties to maintain type consistency

## Deployment Status
✅ Preview: https://homepage-icgtn3c31-core-francisco-parks-projects.vercel.app

## Next Steps
- Monitor Core Web Vitals to measure performance improvements
- Consider implementing image placeholders for better UX
- Could potentially optimize publication thumbnails further
