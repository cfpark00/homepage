# Blog Visualization Plot Improvements
Date: 2025-08-24 03:53
Session: Plot axis labels and tick marks standardization

## Summary
Improved plot visualizations across three blog posts (Random Walk, Double Pendulum, Gradient Optimizer) by standardizing axis labels, tick marks, and fixing display issues.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Build Error Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript error in `optimizer-visualization.tsx` - added missing `H` property to `OptimizerState` interface for Shampoo optimizer
- Fixed path issue in `projects.ts` - corrected metadata.json path from using `process.cwd()` incorrectly

### 2. Random Walk Plot Improvements
- Added y-axis tick marks and numeric labels at 0, midpoint, and max values
- Added x-axis tick marks and numeric labels at 0, midpoint, and max steps  
- Rotated y-axis labels to be on the left side (consistent with other visualizations)
- Centered x-axis labels below the plots
- Increased viewBox height from 150 to 170 to accommodate x-axis labels
- Adjusted transform from `translate(25, 20)` to `translate(35, 20)` for better spacing
- Applied changes to both "Distance vs Steps" and "Distribution" plots

### 3. Gradient Optimizer Initial State Fixes
- Fixed issue where plots showed "-infinity" labels before any optimization runs
- Added `if (runs.length === 0) return null` checks before processing data
- This prevents `Math.max(...[])` returning `-Infinity` and `Math.min(...[])` returning `Infinity`
- Applied fix to both Loss plot and Gradient Magnitude plot y-axis and x-axis tick generation

### 4. Content File Updates (User/Linter Changes)
- `gradient-optimizer-comparison/index.mdx` - removed heading from first line
- `double-pendulum-chaos/index.mdx` - removed heading from first line  
- `double-pendulum.tsx` - various improvements including Lyapunov exponent calculation and legend layout

## Key Learnings
- Always check for empty data arrays before using `Math.max()` or `Math.min()` to avoid infinity values
- Consistent plot styling requires attention to viewBox dimensions, transforms, and label positioning
- The pattern of checking data existence (e.g., `path.length > 1`, `runs.length === 0`) before rendering labels is crucial
