# Beta Blog Password Protection Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-24, 16:40

## Summary
Implemented server-side password protection for the beta research blog section, transitioning from client-side security to a more secure API-based authentication system with token generation and localStorage persistence.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Initial Password Protection Setup
- Created `BetaPasswordGuard` component with client-side password check
- Initially used hardcoded password in component (insecure)
- Wrapped `/blog/beta` page with password protection
- Removed "Back to Blog" button from beta page (users can use top navigation)

### 2. Server-Side Security Migration
**Problem**: Client-side password was visible in browser JavaScript bundle
**Solution**: Moved authentication to server-side API route

- Created `/api/beta-auth/route.ts` API endpoint for password verification
- Implemented token generation using crypto.randomBytes (64-char hex)
- Password stored in environment variable (`BETA_PASSWORD`)
- Added `.env.example` file for easy environment setup

### 3. Storage Enhancement
**Evolution**: sessionStorage â†’ localStorage with expiration
- Initially used sessionStorage (per-tab authentication)
- User requested cross-tab persistence
- Implemented localStorage with 30-day expiration
- Added automatic cleanup of expired tokens

### 4. Individual Post Protection
- Extended password protection to individual beta blog posts
- Modified `/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to conditionally wrap beta posts
- Now both listing page and individual posts are protected

### 5. UI Component Fixes
- Created missing `Label` component for shadcn/ui
- Added to UI package exports
- Updated SHADCN_TIPS.md noting manual component creation (no CLI)

## Technical Details

### Security Model
- **Password**: Stored in `.env.local` (server-side only)
- **Token**: Random 64-character hex string
- **Storage**: localStorage with JSON structure containing token and expiry
- **Expiration**: 30 days from authentication
- **Scope**: All beta content (listing + individual posts)

### Files Created/Modified
- `/apps/web/components/beta-password-guard.tsx` - Password guard component
- `/apps/web/app/api/beta-auth/route.ts` - Authentication API
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/blog/beta/page.tsx` - Beta listing page
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Individual post protection
- `/packages/ui/src/components/label.tsx` - Missing UI component
- `/apps/web/.env.local` - Environment variables (password: CBSNTT)
- `/apps/web/.env.example` - Template for environment setup

## Current State
- Beta research section fully password-protected
- Server-side authentication prevents password exposure
- 30-day token persistence across browser sessions
- Clean UI with loading states and error handling
- Both `/blog/beta` and individual beta post URLs protected
