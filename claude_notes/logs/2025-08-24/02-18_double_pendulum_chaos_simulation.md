# Double Pendulum Chaos Simulation Blog Post

## Date: 2025-08-24, 02:18

## Summary
Created an interactive double pendulum chaos simulation blog post with advanced physics simulation, energy conservation, and chaos visualization through divergence plots. Implemented proper numerical methods to maintain energy conservation and demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Blog Post Creation
- Created new blog folder: `/apps/web/content/blog/double-pendulum-chaos/`
- Built interactive React component with SVG rendering (matching random walk's approach)
- Added MDX content explaining chaos theory and the double pendulum system
- Updated `metadata.json` with blog entry

### 2. Core Simulation Features
- **Multiple pendulums**: Support for 1-16 simultaneous pendulums (default 8)
- **Noise control**: First pendulum has zero noise as reference, others have adjustable initial perturbation
- **Adjustable initial conditions**: Both pendulum angles configurable (-180° to 180°)
- **Speed control**: Simulation speed from 0.1x to 10x
- **Trail visualization**: Adjustable trail length (0-2000 points) showing path history
- **Full history tracking**: No limit on data points for accurate long-term analysis

### 3. Physics Implementation
- **Normalized units**: Set all physical constants to 1 (m₁=m₂=L₁=L₂=g=1) for cleaner equations
- **Energy conservation**: Implemented velocity rescaling after each integration step to maintain constant energy per pendulum
- **Proper coordinate system**: Fixed energy calculation with correct potential energy reference (zero at lowest point)
- **Numerical stability**: Added clamping and NaN checking to prevent divergence
- **Scaled rendering**: 100px per unit length to fit 500x500 SVG viewBox

### 4. Visualization Improvements
- **Energy plot**: Shows individual pendulum energies (thin transparent lines) and average (thick white line)
  - Fixed y-axis: 0 to 2×initial energy
  - Per-pendulum energy tracking to show conservation
  
- **Divergence plot**: RMS Euclidean distance between second pendulum bobs
  - Logarithmic y-scale to show exponential growth
  - Changed from angle-space to real-space distance for physical meaning
  - Only shows when multiple pendulums present

### 5. UI/UX Refinements
- **Single card layout**: Unified design matching random walk visualization
- **Responsive design**: Proper mobile/desktop layout with correct scaling
- **Control organization**:
  - Initial conditions locked during simulation
  - Runtime controls (speed, trails) always adjustable
  - Play/Pause/Reset/Restore Defaults buttons
- **Fixed sizing**: Plots use same sizing policy as random walk (350x150 viewBox)
- **Always visible axes**: Plot labels and axes appear before simulation starts

### 6. Bug Fixes & Optimizations
- Fixed SVG viewBox to prevent pendulum cutoff (scale 150→100)
- Removed Slider component dependency (used native HTML inputs)
- Fixed function initialization order for SSR compatibility
- Corrected energy calculation physics (proper PE reference frame)
- Fixed responsive layout issues at all screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Energy Conservation Method
Implemented post-step velocity rescaling to project solution back to constant energy manifold:
1. Calculate new state using standard Euler integration
2. Compute total energy (KE + PE)
3. Scale velocities to match initial energy: v_new = v * sqrt(E_target/E_current)

### Divergence Metric
RMS Euclidean distance between second pendulum bobs relative to reference (first pendulum):
- More intuitive than angle-space distance
- Avoids modulo 2π wrapping issues
- Direct physical interpretation in normalized length units
