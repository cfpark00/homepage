## Key Tasks Completed

### 2. Content Population - August 25
Created comprehensive thought entries covering:
- Interview completion and freedom from leetcode (17:00)
- Zoom discussion about LLM ablation proposal with friend (18:00)
- Website work plans and celebration with friends (19:00-21:00)

### 5. Content Organization

- Fixed chronological ordering issues (00:05 was after 00:50)
- Renamed all daily titles to better reflect multiple parallel topics
- Corrected timestamps and reorganized entries

## Technical Implementation

### Markdown Link Rendering
```typescript
function renderContent(content: string) {
  // Simple markdown link parser for [text](url) format
  const linkRegex = /\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g
  // Returns JSX with clickable links
}
```

### Data Structure
- Each day has a title and array of thought objects
- Thoughts contain: id, content, time, tags (empty arrays for now)
- Support for markdown links in content field
- Optional link field attempted but reverted to keep content simple

## Files Modified
- `/apps/web/content/thoughts/2025-08-25.json` - Created with 5 thoughts
- `/apps/web/content/thoughts/2025-08-26.json` - Created with 8 thoughts  
- `/apps/web/content/thoughts/2025-08-27.json` - Created with 6 thoughts
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/thoughts/thoughts-client.tsx` - UI fixes and markdown support
- Removed 4 old thought files from Dec 2024 and Jan 2025

## Notes
- User wants tags to be AI-generated later, so all tags arrays are empty
- Password system provides superficial privacy protection
- Content focuses on research ideas, website development, and personal reflections
- Chronological ordering is important for the timeline visualization
