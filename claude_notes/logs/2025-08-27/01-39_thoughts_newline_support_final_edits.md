# Thoughts System Newline Support and Final Content Edits

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Time**: 01:39  
**Session Type**: Bug Fix & Content Completion

## Summary
Added newline support to the thoughts rendering system and completed final content edits for August 25-27 thoughts entries.

## Key Tasks Completed

### 1. Newline Rendering Support
- **Problem**: Newlines in thought content weren't being displayed
- **Solution**: Updated `renderContent()` function to split content by newlines and insert `<br/>` elements
- **Implementation**: Each paragraph is processed separately for markdown links, then joined with line breaks

### 2. Content Additions
- **August 25 17:00**: Added detailed coding interview experience and merged with celebration entry
- **August 26 22:00**: Added thought about synthetic data for concept ablation studies
- **August 26 22:10**: Added plan to research across multiple AI models

### 3. Title Updates
- Renamed all three days' titles to better reflect multiple parallel topics:
  - Aug 25: "Interviews, LLM Ablation, Website Work, Drinks"
  - Aug 26: "Hangover, LLM Proposal, MDX Debug, CI/CD, Synthetic Data"  
  - Aug 27: "Brain Evolution, Continual Learning, Website UI, Memory Reconstruction"

## Technical Changes

### Updated renderContent Function
```typescript
function renderContent(content: string) {
  // Split by newlines first
  const paragraphs = content.split('\n')
  
  return paragraphs.map((paragraph, pIndex) => {
    // Process markdown links for each paragraph
    // Return with <br/> between paragraphs
  })
}
```
