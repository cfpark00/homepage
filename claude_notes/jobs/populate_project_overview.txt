# Instructions for Populating Project Overview via User Interview

This guide helps AI agents populate comprehensive project overview data by conducting structured interviews with users about their research projects.

## Overview Location
Project overviews are stored at: `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/apps/portal/content/projects/[project-slug]/overview.json`

## Interview Process

### Phase 1: Core Concept
Start with understanding the fundamental research question:
1. **Opening Question**: "What is the main research question or hypothesis you're investigating in the [project-name] project? Please provide a brief abstract describing what this research aims to understand."
   - This establishes the `proposalAbstract` field
   - Gets the user thinking about their project's core purpose

### Phase 2: Experimental Approach
2. **Methods Question**: "What are the main experiments you're planning or have already conducted?"
   - Gather information for `coreExperiments` array
   - Ask about experimental status (planned/in-progress/completed)
   - Note any preliminary results

### Phase 3: Timeline and Milestones
3. **Milestones Question**: "What are the key milestones you envision for this project?"
   - Build the `milestones` array
   - If user doesn't provide dates, ask if they want dates or prefer to omit them
   - If no dates, don't include targetDate fields
   - Focus on logical progression of work

### Phase 4: Resources
4. **Resources Question**: "What computational resources will you need for this project?"
   - Populate `expectedResources` array
   - Ask about: compute (GPUs), storage, personnel, software/tools
   - Note status (available/requested/allocated)

### Phase 5: Theoretical Background
5. **Related Work Question**: "What existing research does your project build upon?"
   - Gather information for `relatedResearch` section
   - Ask for specific papers or research areas
   - Note if papers need to be added to literature tab

### Phase 6: Expected Outcomes
6. **Results Question**: "What are your anticipated findings or hypotheses?"
   - Build `expectedResults` section
   - Ask about specific hypotheses to test
   - What insights they hope to uncover

### Phase 7: Impact and Applications
7. **Impact Question**: "How do you see this research contributing to the field?"
   - Create `broaderImpact` section
   - Ask about practical applications
   - Potential benefits to AI/ML community

### Phase 8: Challenges
8. **Objections Question**: "What potential objections or challenges do you anticipate reviewers might raise about this approach?"
   - Build `potentialObjections` section
   - Include user's responses to these objections
   - Shows thoughtful consideration of limitations

## Important Guidelines

### Required Reading Before Starting
1. **Literature Guidelines**: `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/claude_notes/docs/portal_projects/adding_literature.md`
   - Understand proper paper formatting
   - Learn about items.json structure
   - Critical: Always use real abstracts from arXiv, never summaries
2. **Thought Writing**: `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/claude_notes/jobs/thought_writing.txt`
   - For documenting the planning session
   - Query time before adding thoughts

### Interviewing Best Practices
- **IMPORTANT: One question at a time**: Ask ONLY ONE question per message - never bundle multiple questions together
- **Build on responses**: Use their answers to ask clarifying follow-ups
- **Capture their voice**: Preserve the user's terminology and phrasing
- **Note connections**: When they mention papers/resources, note if these need to be added to literature

### Data Structure Requirements
- All projects need: `proposalAbstract`, `milestones`, `coreExperiments`, `expectedResources`
- The `detailedProposal` object should contain: `backgroundMotivation`, `relatedResearch`, `researchRoadmap`, `expectedResults`, `broaderImpact`, `potentialObjections`
- Milestones don't require dates - omit `targetDate` if user doesn't specify
- Each experiment should have: id, name, description, status, estimatedDuration (can be rough)

### After Information Gathering
1. Create the complete `overview.json` file with all gathered information
2. **CRITICAL**: Read `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/claude_notes/docs/portal_projects/adding_literature.md` for proper literature formatting
3. Add any mentioned papers to `literature.json` following the literature guidelines
   - MUST fetch real abstracts from arXiv using WebFetch
   - Never write summaries as abstracts
   - Use proper date format: "Month Year" not "YYYY-MM-DD"
4. **CRITICAL**: Read `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/claude_notes/jobs/thought_writing.txt` for thought formatting guidelines
5. Query current time using `date '+%H:%M'` command before adding thoughts
6. Document the planning session in the project's `thoughts.json` file
7. Include key decisions, methodological choices, and reasoning

## Example Interview Flow

```
AI: "What is the main research question or hypothesis you're investigating in the [project] project?"
User: [Provides abstract]

AI: "Thank you! That's fascinating. Now let me ask about your experimental approach. What are the main experiments you're planning or have already conducted?"
User: [Describes experiments]

AI: "I see - you're in the [stage] phase. Let me ask about your research timeline. What are the key milestones you envision for this project?"
User: [Lists milestones]

[Continue through all phases...]
```

## Common User Patterns
- Users may not have specific dates - that's fine, omit them
- Users often mention papers informally - probe for proper citations
- Users may give brief answers initially - ask follow-ups for detail
- Some sections may be more developed than others - that's normal

## Final Steps
1. Show user you're creating the overview.json
2. Add mentioned papers with FULL abstracts from arxiv (use WebFetch to get real abstracts)
3. **Query current time**: Use `date '+%H:%M'` to get HH:MM format
4. Create thoughtful project thoughts documenting the session in `thoughts.json`
   - Read `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/claude_notes/jobs/thought_writing.txt` first
   - Add multiple thought entries with the same timestamp
   - Include appropriate tags for each thought
5. Clean up any temporary files

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Read `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/claude_notes/docs/portal_projects/adding_literature.md` before adding papers
- [ ] Abstract clearly states the research question
- [ ] Milestones show logical progression
- [ ] Experiments have clear descriptions and status
- [ ] Resources are specific and quantified
- [ ] Related work is properly cited
- [ ] Expected results include specific hypotheses
- [ ] Broader impact explains significance
- [ ] Potential objections show critical thinking
- [ ] All mentioned papers added to literature.json with real abstracts from arXiv
- [ ] Paper format follows literature guidelines (proper date format, real abstracts)
- [ ] Current time queried before adding thoughts
- [ ] Thoughts document the planning session with proper timestamps
- [ ] Thought writing guidelines from `/Users/cfpark00/mysite/claude_notes/jobs/thought_writing.txt` followed

Remember: The goal is to help the user articulate and structure their research vision, not to impose a rigid format. Adapt questions based on the project's nature and the user's responses.
