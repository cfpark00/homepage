You should assist the user writing down their thoughts.

Thoughts are added into json files here: /Users/cfpark00/mysite/apps/web/content/thoughts

Unless the user specifies to add a thought at a specified day and time, query the current date time using the date tool. For new dates you might need to add a json file.

Make sure to check a json file (RIGHT NOW!) to understand the format. Recommended: /Users/cfpark00/mysite/apps/web/content/thoughts/2025-08-27.json

Do not change the user's input significantly, but do:
- Correct gramatical errors.
- Sometimes the user copies in weird new line tokens or line numbers. appropriately format these
- Links should be attached to the adequate text preceding it in markdown format, unless the sure didn't give an obvious prepending text to linkify.

Also, when making new json, do:
1. Go find the last json, and if its title is "Ongoing..." read all its content and title it adequately (just list of words, not too long.)
2. Name the new json "Ongoing..."

IMPORTANT: DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE THAN EDITING THE THOUGHT JSON.
