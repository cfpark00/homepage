# Navigation UI Improvements
**Date**: 2025-08-21
**Time**: 21:53
**Session Focus**: Navigation bar active state indicator improvements

## Summary
Made UI improvements to the navigation bar to better indicate the currently active page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Active State Indicator
- **File**: `apps/web/components/navigation.tsx`
- Initially added an underline indicator for active navigation items
  - Desktop: Horizontal underline beneath active link
  - Mobile: Vertical bar on the left side of active link
- Used 2px thickness initially (`h-0.5` / `w-0.5`)
- Refined to 1px thickness (`h-px` / `w-px`) for a more subtle appearance
- Ultimately removed the indicators based on user preference
- Final state: Relying solely on font opacity changes (100% for active, 60% for inactive)

### 2. Ongoing Page Updates (User-Modified)
- **File**: `apps/web/app/(default)/ongoing/page.tsx`
- User made several adjustments to project descriptions:
  - Simplified Orchestra platform description
  - Updated Research Tracking System description
  - Note: Page now includes modal for external link confirmation and responsive grid layout

## Key Decisions
- Started with more prominent visual indicators for active navigation items
- Iterated through different thicknesses for the indicator bars
- Ultimately removed indicators entirely based on user feedback that the font opacity change was sufficient
- Clean, minimalist approach preferred over additional visual elements

## Files Modified
- `apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` - Navigation component with active state styling

## Notes
- User preferred the simpler, cleaner look with just opacity changes
- The existing contrast (100% vs 60% opacity) provides adequate visual distinction
- Mobile and desktop navigation both use the same visual treatment for consistency
