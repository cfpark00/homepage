**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Time:** 18:53  
**Project:** Academic Homepage - Final Polish and UI Cleanup

## Summary
Final session focused on polishing the website for deployment, removing placeholder content, and hiding unfinished sections.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Blog Page Subtitle Removal
- **Task**: Remove "Thoughts on research, technology, and academia" subtitle
- **Location**: `/apps/web/app/(default)/blog/page.tsx` (line 17)
- **Change**: Removed the `<p>` element containing the subtitle text
- **Result**: Cleaner, more minimal blog page header with just "Blog" title

### 2. Research Page Hidden
- **Task**: Hide the Research page as it's not deployment ready
- **Location**: `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` (line 15)
- **Change**: Commented out `{ name: "Research", href: "/projects" }`
- **Note**: Added comment "Hidden until deployment ready" for future reference
- **Result**: Research link removed from both desktop and mobile navigation menus

## Files Modified
1. `/apps/web/app/(default)/blog/page.tsx` - Removed subtitle text
2. `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` - Commented out Research navigation item

## Deployment Status
- Blog page now has cleaner presentation without philosophical subtitle
- Research section temporarily hidden from navigation
- Site ready for deployment with only finished sections visible
- Research page can be easily re-enabled by uncommenting line 15 in navigation.tsx

## Next Steps (Future)
- Complete Research page content and styling
- Uncomment Research navigation when ready
- Consider adding actual blog posts to replace "No blog posts yet" message
