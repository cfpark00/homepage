**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Time:** 19:06  
**Project:** Website Publication System Fixes and UI Improvements

## Summary
Fixed GIF looping issues, updated publication links, improved flying publications animation transparency, removed unfinished features, and updated simple page with accurate information.

## Major Tasks Completed

### 1. Publication GIF Looping Fix
- **Issue Identified**: `vdm4cdm_2d.gif` was not set to loop infinitely
- **Solution**: Used ImageMagick to set loop iteration to 0 (infinite)
- **Verified**: All 6 GIFs now loop continuously:
  - dustmap_correction.gif ✓
  - iclr_gif.gif ✓
  - targettrack.gif ✓
  - vdm4cdm_2d.gif ✓ (fixed)
  - vdm4cdm_3d.gif ✓
  - whole_brain_imaging.gif ✓

### 2. Publication Link Updates
- **B.S. Thesis**: Added Google Drive link for CAPP DAQ thesis
- **Ph.D. Thesis**: Link already present and correct

### 3. Flying Publications Animation Transparency
- **Initial Problem**: Flying objects completely obscured by opaque page elements
- **Iterations**:
  1. First attempt: Made sections 95% opaque (too opaque)
  2. Second attempt: Reduced to 50% opacity with backdrop blur
  3. Final solution: 50% opacity WITHOUT backdrop blur for cleaner look
- **Elements Updated**:
  - Hero section: 50% opacity
  - Content section: 50% opacity  
  - ChatBox: 60% opacity
  - Footer: 50% opacity
  - Email input: 70% opacity

### 4. Component Visibility Management
- **ChatBox**: Commented out (not deployment ready)
- **Newsletter Subscription**: Commented out (not deployment ready)
- **Code preserved**: Both components can be easily re-enabled

### 5. Simple Page Complete Overhaul
- **Content Updates**:
  - Current position as Postdoctoral Fellow (May 2025 - Present)
  - Complete education history with Ph.D. thesis title
  - 11 selected publications with first author notation
  - Research interests with specific focus areas
  - Removed Twitter/X reference
  - Streamlined sections (removed Awards, Experience, Recent Talks)
  - Updated links (removed LinkedIn and ORCID)

- **Layout Changes**:
  - Added profile picture (rectangular, 120x160px) floating left
  - Picture covers height of name and position info
  - Added "good websites" link at very top of page
  - Maintained 1995-style raw HTML aesthetic

### 6. Navigation Bar Picture Management
- **Mistake**: Initially added picture to main navigation bar
- **Correction**: Removed from main nav, added only to simple page
- **Final state**: Clean main navigation, picture only on simple page

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `/apps/web/lib/publications-data.ts` - Updated thesis links
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/page.tsx` - Transparency fixes, commented components
- `/apps/web/components/chat-box.tsx` - Transparency improvements
- `/apps/web/app/(default)/layout.tsx` - Footer transparency
- `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` - Removed accidentally added picture
- `/apps/web/app/simple/page.tsx` - Complete content and layout update
- `/apps/web/components/flying-publications.tsx` - Updated image list

### Image Files
- `/public/images/publications/vdm4cdm_2d.gif` - Fixed infinite loop

## Technical Details

### GIF Loop Fix Command
```bash
magick /path/to/vdm4cdm_2d.gif -loop 0 /path/to/vdm4cdm_2d_fixed.gif
```

### Transparency CSS Classes Used
- `bg-background/50` - 50% opacity
- `bg-background/60` - 60% opacity  
- `bg-background/70` - 70% opacity
- `bg-background/90` - 90% opacity (footer initially)
- Removed all `backdrop-blur-sm` for cleaner appearance

## Design Decisions

1. **No Gradients**: Removed gradient backgrounds for consistent transparency
2. **No Blur Effects**: Cleaner visual with pure transparency
3. **Simple Page Philosophy**: Maintained authentic 1995 HTML style while updating content
4. **Component Hiding**: Preserved code for future deployment rather than deleting

## Results

- Flying publications now visible throughout entire page
- All GIFs loop properly for continuous animation
- Simple page provides accurate, comprehensive information in retro style
- Main site ready for deployment with unfinished features safely hidden
- Clean, consistent transparency across all page sections
