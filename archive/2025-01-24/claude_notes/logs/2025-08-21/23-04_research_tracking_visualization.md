# Research Tracking System Visualization Development
**Date**: 2025-08-21
**Time**: 23:04
**Session Focus**: Building React Flow visualization for Research Tracking System and creating reusable publication components

## Summary
Developed a comprehensive research tracking visualization system using React Flow to display the Markov ICL research journey. Implemented an algorithmic layout system for 71 research nodes and created a reusable publication card component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Research Tracking Page Development
- **File**: `apps/web/app/(default)/research-tracking/page.tsx`
- Removed tabs-based interface, replaced with streamlined content-focused layout
- Added vision section with compact layout (reduced font sizes and margins)
- Integrated React Flow visualization showing actual research process
- Added publication card reference for "Competition Dynamics" paper
- Used PageContainer for consistent layout

### 2. React Flow Integration
- **Package Installation**: 
  - `@xyflow/react` (v12.3.7) for flow visualization
  - `react-icons` (v5.4.0) for additional icons
- **File**: `apps/web/components/research-flow.tsx` (new)
- Created custom node component with 13 different node types
- Each type has distinct color and icon (question, hypothesis, experiment, observation, etc.)
- Implemented date formatting (e.g., "2 days ago", "3 months ago")

### 3. Research Tree Data Management
- **Files**: 
  - `apps/web/lib/research-tree-vertical.json` (copied from orchestra-app-dev)
  - `apps/web/lib/research-tree-data.ts` (new)
- Contains 71 nodes representing the complete Markov ICL research journey
- Originally horizontal layout, converted to vertical through coordinate swapping

### 4. Layout Algorithm Development
- **File**: `apps/web/lib/reorganize-layout.js` (created, then logic moved to component)
- Implemented topological sort for proper parent-child relationships
- Algorithm ensures:
  - Root nodes at level 0
  - Each child level = max(parent levels) + 1
  - Horizontal positioning to minimize edge crossings
  - Minimum separation distance to prevent overlaps
- Final implementation moved directly into React Flow component for dynamic calculation

### 5. Publication Card Component
- **File**: `apps/web/components/publication-card.tsx` (new)
- Created reusable component matching exact style from publications page
- Features:
  - Expandable abstracts with click interaction
  - Venue as button linking to arxiv/doi
  - Author formatting (bold for first authors, underline for C.F. Park)
  - Support for thumbnail images with FileText fallback
  - "Other forms:" section for related publications
- Used on research-tracking page to reference the Markov ICL paper

### 6. UI Refinements
- Removed React Flow attribution text using `proOptions={{ hideAttribution: true }}`
- Adjusted spacing to prevent S-shaped curves in connections
- Implemented adaptive horizontal spreading based on node count
- Added I. Pres as co-author to the publication data

### 7. Dialog Component Creation
- **File**: `packages/ui/src/components/dialog.tsx` (new)
- Created manually using Radix UI primitives when shadcn CLI failed
- Required for external link confirmation modal on ongoing page

## Technical Decisions

1. **Layout Algorithm**: Chose pure algorithmic approach over storing coordinates in JSON
2. **React Flow**: Selected for its flexibility and performance with large graphs
3. **Component Reusability**: Created PublicationCard to maintain consistency across pages
4. **Vertical Layout**: Converted from horizontal to vertical for better scrolling experience

## Challenges Resolved

1. **Overlapping Nodes**: Implemented minimum separation distance algorithm
2. **S-Shaped Curves**: Increased horizontal spacing for parent-child relationships
3. **Root Node Position**: Fixed JavaScript falsy issue (0 || 10 evaluating to 10)
4. **Type Errors**: Added proper TypeScript casting for React Flow node data

## File Structure Changes
- Added `apps/web/components/research-flow.tsx`
- Added `apps/web/components/publication-card.tsx`
- Added `apps/web/lib/research-tree-data.ts`
- Added `apps/web/lib/research-tree-vertical.json`
- Added `packages/ui/src/components/dialog.tsx`

## Dependencies Added
- @xyflow/react: ^12.3.7
- react-icons: ^5.4.0

## Notes
- PageContainer system is properly utilized for consistent layout
- All changes follow the established coding guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- Research visualization successfully displays the complete 71-node research journey
