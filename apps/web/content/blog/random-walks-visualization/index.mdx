A random walk is a mathematical formalization of a path consisting of a succession of random steps. It's a fundamental concept in probability theory with applications ranging from physics to finance.

## Interactive Demo

Try the simulation below. Watch how a particle moves randomly on a 2D grid, taking steps in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) with equal probability.

## The Mathematics

In this 2D random walk simulation, the particle takes discrete steps on a grid. At each time step, it randomly chooses one of four directions with equal probability (1/4 each):
- **Up**: (x, y) → (x, y+1)
- **Right**: (x, y) → (x+1, y)  
- **Down**: (x, y) → (x, y-1)
- **Left**: (x, y) → (x-1, y)

## What the Plots Show

### Distance from Origin Plot (Left)
The blue line tracks the actual distance from the origin over time, while the gray dashed line shows the expected value **E[r] ≈ √t**. Notice how the actual distance fluctuates around this theoretical prediction - sometimes wandering far, sometimes returning closer to home.

### Distance Distribution Plot (Right)
This shows the probability distribution of distances at the current time step. The curve represents the theoretical Rayleigh distribution, and the red line marks where your walker currently is. Most walks end up near the peak of the distribution, but outliers are always possible!

## Key Insights

### Distance Growth
After t steps, the root-mean-square distance from the origin is **√t**. This sublinear growth means:
- After 100 steps: typically ~10 units away
- After 10,000 steps: typically ~100 units away
- After 1,000,000 steps: typically ~1,000 units away

The walker explores space much more slowly than linear motion would suggest!

### Statistical Behavior
While individual walks are unpredictable, the ensemble behavior follows precise statistical laws. The distribution plot shows this beautifully - your single walk is just one sample from this probability distribution.

## Questions to Ponder
- Why does the actual distance oscillate around the √t line?
- Can you get your walker to return very close to the origin after 10,000 steps?
- What fraction of walks end up beyond 2 standard deviations from the expected distance?

The beauty of random walks lies in their simplicity - just random steps - yet they exhibit rich mathematical properties and model countless real-world phenomena.
