A random walk is a mathematical formalization of a path consisting of a succession of random steps. It's a fundamental concept in probability theory with applications ranging from physics to finance.

## Interactive Demo

Try the simulation below. Watch how a particle moves randomly on a 2D grid, taking steps in one of four directions (up, down, left, right) with equal probability.

## The Mathematics

In our 2D random walk, at each time step, the walker moves from its current position (x, y) to a new position by adding a displacement vector.

**The new position = current position + displacement**

The displacement vector is chosen uniformly from these four options: 
- up (0,1)
- down (0,-1)
- right (1,0)
- left (-1,0)

## Key Properties

### Expected Distance from Origin

After t steps, the expected squared distance from the origin follows:

**E[r²] = t**

This means the expected distance grows as √t - much slower than if the walker moved in a straight line!

### Return to Origin

In 2D, a random walker will return to the origin with probability 1 (almost surely), though the expected time to return is infinite. This is known as **Pólya's theorem**.

### Diffusion

Random walks model diffusion processes. The probability distribution of the walker's position after many steps approaches a Gaussian distribution, as predicted by the central limit theorem.

## Applications

Random walks appear everywhere:

- **Physics**: Brownian motion of particles in fluids
- **Finance**: Stock price models (with modifications)
- **Computer Science**: Random sampling algorithms, Monte Carlo methods
- **Biology**: Animal foraging patterns, molecular movement
- **Networks**: PageRank algorithm, epidemic spreading

## Try This

1. Run multiple walks and observe the variety of paths
2. Notice how rarely the walker strays very far from the origin
3. Use "Fast" mode to see the long-term behavior over 1000 steps
4. Consider: If you ran this forever, would the walker eventually visit every point on the grid?

The beauty of random walks lies in their simplicity - just random steps - yet they exhibit rich mathematical properties and model countless real-world phenomena.
