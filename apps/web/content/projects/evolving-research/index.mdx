## Core Belief

**Research methodologies are not static but evolve like living systems**

By applying evolutionary principles to understand how research practices develop, adapt, and spread, 
we can accelerate scientific progress and create more effective discovery frameworks for both humans and AI systems.

## Planned Investigations

### Evolutionary Fitness of Research Strategies
Modeling different research approaches as competing strategies in an evolutionary landscape, 
measuring their success rates, resource efficiency, and ability to produce novel insights.

### Digital Organisms for Hypothesis Generation
Creating digital organisms that evolve to generate and test hypotheses, 
studying how complexity and insight emerge from simple evolutionary rules.

### Meta-Research Evolution
Tracking how research about research itself has evolved over time, 
identifying key transitions in how we understand and optimize the discovery process.

## Open Questions

- How do successful research strategies spread and mutate across scientific communities?
- Can we identify universal patterns in how breakthrough discoveries emerge?
- What role does diversity of approaches play in accelerating collective discovery?
- How can AI systems develop their own evolving research methodologies?
