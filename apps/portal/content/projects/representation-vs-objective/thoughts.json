The core question crystallized: does the distinction between diffusion and autoregressive models really matter if the right representations are formed? Using the Star Graph task as our testbed - a problem where autoregression provably fails but diffusion succeeds.",

This is the critical test - if AR can succeed with diffusion's representations, it suggests the optimization landscape, not the objective function itself, is the barrier.",

The user suggests noise injection might provide 'escape velocity' from these plateaus. Also noted that RL won't help without the right representations - it's a chicken-and-egg problem.",
