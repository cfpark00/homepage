        "content": "Completed comprehensive overview planning session for Evolution of Research project. The core question is fascinating: what evolutionary environments give rise to research abilities in organisms? The hypothesis that research behavior might emerge from simple multi-agent bandits rather than complex 3D environments is counterintuitive but compelling.",

        "content": "Key insight from the planning: research behavior may require three conditions - (1) sufficient resources for exploration beyond immediate survival, (2) environments with learnable complexities, and (3) inadmissibility of a single best solution. This last point connects beautifully to open-ended evolution principles.",

The milestone progression is well-structured: (1) Import/setup algorithms, (2) Establish comprehensive baselines, (3) Search for research-like behaviors, (4) Characterize research-generating environments.",

If we do succeed, criticisms about artificial/simplistic settings can be addressed by arguing this is a novel area where starting simple is appropriate.",
