  "proposalAbstract": "This research project investigates the emergence of reasoning capabilities in large language models through systematic ablation studies and mechanistic interpretability. We aim to identify the critical components and training dynamics that enable complex reasoning, with a focus on understanding how different architectural choices and training objectives contribute to emergent cognitive abilities.

    "backgroundMotivation": "Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities that were not explicitly programmed, emerging instead from scale and training on diverse text. However, the mechanisms underlying these capabilities remain poorly understood. This gap in understanding limits our ability to reliably improve reasoning performance, predict failure modes, and build more capable systems. Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown promise in reverse-engineering neural networks, but these techniques have not been systematically applied to understand reasoning emergence. Our research addresses this critical gap by combining systematic experimentation with interpretability analysis to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of reasoning in language models.",
    "relatedResearch": "Our work builds on several research threads:\n\n1. **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Olsson et al. (2022) on in-context learning circuits; Nanda et al. (2023) on grokking and phase transitions; Anthropic's work on superposition and feature discovery.\n\n2. **Reasoning in LLMs**: Wei et al. (2022) on chain-of-thought prompting; Lewkowycz et al. (2022) on mathematical reasoning with Minerva; recent work on process supervision and reasoning traces.\n\n3. **Scaling Laws**: Kaplan et al. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) on compute-optimal scaling; emerging work on task-specific scaling laws and capability jumps.\n\n4. **Architecture Comparisons**: Recent developments in state-space models (Mamba), hybrid architectures, and their implications for different cognitive capabilities.",

We also contribute new interpretability methods specifically designed for reasoning analysis.\n\n**Objection 2: \"Findings may not generalize across architectures\"**\nResponse: We explicitly test across multiple architectures (Transformer, Mamba, hybrids) and scales to ensure robust, generalizable findings.\n\n**Objection 3: \"Computational requirements are prohibitive\"**\nResponse: We've designed experiments to maximize insight per compute hour, using efficient ablation strategies and focusing on the most informative model scales. Our preliminary work shows we can achieve meaningful results with academic-scale resources.\n\n**Objection 4: \"The research timeline is too ambitious\"**\nResponse: We have already completed preliminary experiments validating our approach. The team has extensive experience with similar projects, and we've built in buffer time for unexpected challenges."
