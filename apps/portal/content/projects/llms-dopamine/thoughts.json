        "content": "Outlined the core research question: whether LLMs develop emergent representations of reward through pretraining and post-training, analogous to dopaminergic systems in biological agents. The key insight is that as LLMs show enhanced agentic abilities, they might have evolved internal guidance systems.",

        "content": "This is genuinely exploratory research - we have no prior hypothesis about what we'll find. We might discover clear reward representations, partial signals, or nothing at all. Even null results would be scientifically valuable as they would constrain theories about how LLMs process information.",
